<h4>PREFACE.</h4>

<p><img src="images/ill_t.png" class="floatLeft" alt="T" /> HE
reproductive powers of Nature were regarded by the nations of
remote antiquity with an awe and reverence so great, as to form an
object of worship, under a symbol, of all others the most
significant,&mdash;the <i>Phallus</i>; and thus was founded a
religion, of which the traces exist to this day, not in Asia only,
but even in Europe itself.</p>

<p>That scarcely any notices of this worship should appear in
modern works, except in the erudite pages of a few antiquarians may
be accounted for by considering the difference of opinion between
the ancients and the moderns as to what constitutes&mdash;modesty;
the former being unable to see any moral turpitude in actions they
regarded was the designs of nature, while the latter, by their
over-strained notions of delicacy, render themselves, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>in some
degree at least, obnoxious to the charge that, in proportion as
manners becomes corrupt, language becomes more
guarded,&mdash;modesty, when banished from the heart, taking refuge
on the lips.</p>

<p>To supply, to some extent, this lacuna in our popular literature
has been the object of the present work, in which, it is hoped, may
be found much curious and interesting physiological information,
interspersed with <i>recherch&eacute;</i> and festivous
anecdotes.</p>

<p>The text is illustrated by a few plates, drawn from antiquarian
sources.</p>

<h4>ESSAY I.</h4>

<h4>REMARKS UPON THE SYMBOLS OF THE<br />
REPRODUCTIVE POWERS.</h4>

<p><img src="images/ill_f.png" class="floatLeft" alt="F" />ROM the
investigations and researches of the learned, there appears to be
no doubt but that the most ancient of all superstitions was that in
which Nature was contemplated chiefly under the attribute or
property of fecundity; the symbols of the reproductive power being
those under which its prolific potencies were exhibited. It is not
because modern fastidiousness affects to consider those symbols as
indecent, and even obscene, that we should therefore suppose them
to have been so regarded by the ancients: on the contrary, the view
of them awakened no impure ideas in the minds of the latter, being
regarded by them as the most sacred objects of worship. The
ancients, indeed, did not look upon the pleasures of love with the
same eye as the moderns do; the tender union of the sexes excited
their veneration, because religion appeared to consecrate it,
inasmuch as their mythology presented to them all Olympus as more
occupied with amatory delights than with the government of the
universe.</p>

<p>The reflecting men of those times, more simple, but, it must
be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
confessed, more profound, than those of our own day, could not see
any moral turpitude in actions regarded by them as the design of
nature, and as the acme of felicity. For this reason it is that we
find not only ancient writers expressing themselves freely upon
subjects regarded by us as indecent, but even sculptors and
painters equally unrestrained in this particular.</p>

<p>The statesman took advantage of these religious impressions:
whatever tended to increase population being held in honour. Those
images and Priapi so frequently found in the temples of the
ancients, and even in their houses, and which we consider as
objects of indecent lewdness, were, in their eyes, but so many
sacred motives exciting them to propagate their species.</p>

<p>In order to represent by a physical object the reproductive
power of the sun in spring-time, as well as the action of that
power on all sentient beings, the ancients adopted that symbol of
the male gender which the Greeks, who derive it from the Egyptians,
called&mdash;Phallus.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a
href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> This worship was so
general as to have spread itself over a large portion of the
habitable globe, for it flourished for many ages in Egypt and
Syria, Persia, Asia Minor, Greece and Italy: it was, and still is,
in vigour in India and many parts of Africa, and was even found in
America on its discovery by the Spaniards. Thus Garcilaso de la
Vega informs us<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> that, in the public squares of
Panuco (a Mexican town), <i>bas-<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>reliefs</i> were found which, like
those of India, represented, in various ways the sexual union;
while at Tlascala, another town of that country, the reproductive
act was worshipped under the joint symbol of the generative organs,
male and female.</p>

<p>A more surprising fact is, that this worship has, as will be
shewn hereafter, been perpetuated to a very late date, among the
Christians of Europe.</p>

<p>In its origin, the Phallus or emblem of the generative and
procreative powers of nature appears to have been of a very simple
and inoffensive character&mdash;although it was afterwards made
subservient to the grossest and most superstitious purposes.</p>

<p>In India this worship is everywhere to be found accompanying the
triune God, called by the Hindoos, <i>Trimourti</i> or
<i>Trinity</i>, and the significant form of the single obelisk or
pillar called the <i>Linga</i> or <i>Lingham</i>;<a name=
"FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class=
"fnanchor">3</a> and it should be observed, in justice to the
Hindoos that it is some comparative and negative praise to them,
that this emblem, under which they express the elements and
operations of nature is not externally indecorous. Unlike the
abominable realities of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, we see this Indian
phallic emblem in the Hindoo religious exhibitions, without
offence, nor know, until information be extorted, that we are
contemplating a symbol whose prototype is obscene.<a name=

<p>Besides the Lingham, the equally significant <i>Yoni</i> or
<i>Cteis</i> is to be seen, being the female organ of generation.
It is sometimes single, often in conjunction, for the Indians,
believing that the emblem of fecundity might be rendered more
energetic by combining the organs of both sexes, did so unite them,
giving to this double symbol the name of <i>Pulleiar</i>,
confounded by some writers with the Lingham itself. This pulleiar
is highly venerated by the sectarian worshippers of Siva (the third
god of the Trimourti), who hang it round their neck, as a charm or
amulet, or enclosing it in a small box, fasten it upon their arm.
The Indians have also a little jewel called <i>taly</i>, worn, in
like manner, by females round their necks as a charm. It is
presented to them on their wedding day by their husbands, who
receive it from the hands of the Brahmins. Upon these jewels is
engraved the representation, either of the Lingham or of the
Pulleiar. The following anecdote connected with this custom is
given by M. Sonnerat.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>"A Capuchin missionary had a serious dispute with the Jesuits
residing at Pondicherry, which was referred for decision to the
judicial courts. The disciples of Loyola, who can be toleration
itself when toleration furthers their crafty and ambitious views,
had declined all interference with the above custom. M. Tournon,
the Pope's legate apostolic, who regarded the matter as one not to
be trifled with, and with whom, moreover, the Jesuits were no
favourites, strictly prohibited the <i>taly</i>, enjoining all
female converts to substitute in its place either a cross or a
medal of the Virgin. The Indian women, strongly attached to their
ancient customs, refused obedience. The missionaries, apprehensive
of losing the fruits of their zealous labours, and seeing the
number of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id=
"Page_5">5</a></span>their neophytes daily diminishing, entered
into a compromise by adopting a <i>mezzo-termine</i> with the
females in question, and it was agreed that a Cross should be
engraved upon the <i>taly</i>, an arrangement by which the symbol
of Christian salvation was coupled with that of the male and female
<i>pudenda</i>."</p>

<p>The deep and enthusiastic veneration felt by the Hindoos for
this worship is naturally explained by their intense anxiety and
desire for having children who might perform those ceremonies to
their <i>manes</i> which they firmly and piously believe will have
the effect of mitigating their punishment in the world to come.
They worship the <i>Lingham</i>, therefore, for the sake of having
progeny, and husbands, whose wives are barren, send them to adore
that symbol, and, if report be true, the ladies take especial care
not to disappoint the wish of their dear spouses.</p>

<p>It is probable that the introduction of this worship is due to
the Indians who founded the sect of Siva, imagining, as they no
doubt did, that the most effectual means of propagating it would be
by presenting their deity under the form of that organ by which the
reproduction of the human race is effected.</p>

<p>Nothing can be a greater proof of the high antiquity of the
Indians than this worship, it being certain that the Egyptians did
not establish it, as well as the dogma of the Metempsychosis, among
themselves, until after they had travelled in India.</p>

<p>Phalli, usually in lead, have been even found in the river
Rh&ocirc;ne. These were most likely the signs and tokens belonging
to some secret society probably of a licentious character. Similar
ones are in the <i>Forgeais</i> collection, and were engraved in
the <i>Plombs Histori&eacute;s</i> of that antiquarian.<a name=

<p>According to an ingenious writer,<a name="FNanchor_7" id=

is of opinion that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id=

colonists to Ireland, the round towers, so numerous in that island,
are no other than ancient Phallic temples erected in honour of the
fructifying power of nature emanating, as it was supposed to do,
from the sun, under the name of Sol, Ph&oelig;bus, Apollo, Abad, or
Budh.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"

<p>Alluding to these towers, Mr O'Brien observes, "the eastern
votaries, suiting the action to the idea, and that their vivid
imaginations might be still more enlivened by the very <i>form</i>
of the <i>temple</i>, actually constructed its architecture after
the model of the <i>membrum virile</i>, which, obscenity apart, is
the divinity-formed and indispensable medium selected by God
himself for human propagation and sexual prolificacy." There is
every reason to believe that our <i>May-pole</i> is a relic of the
ancient Phallic worship.</p>

<p>The manners of the ancient Hebrews seem to have differed little,
if at all, in this respect, from those of the nations surrounding
them: thus, David, dancing with all his might before the ark,
lifted up his ephod and exhibited his nakedness to "the eyes of the
handmaids of his servants." No blame is attached to the king for
such gross indecency during a public and religious ceremony; while
Michal, his wife, was punished with barrenness, for expressing her
disapprobation of his conduct.<a name="FNanchor_9" id=
"FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>This example attests the great respect entertained by the
Hebrews for the organs of generation;<a name="FNanchor_10" id=
"FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
but we have a further <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id=
"Page_7">7</a></span>proof of this reverence for them in the fact
that, when taking a solemn oath, they placed their hand upon them
in token of its inviolability: When Abraham, addressing "his oldest
servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had," is made to
say, "Put I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and I will make
thee swear, by the Lord, the God of Heaven, and the God of the
earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son, of the daughters
of the Canaanites:"<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a
href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and when Jacob, at the
point of death, "called his son Joseph, and said unto him, "If now
I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under
my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray
thee, in Egypt,"<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> the Hebrew text has been
incorrectly translated in both these instances; for, according to
learned commentators, it is not the <i>thigh</i>, but the
<i>phallus</i> that is meant; such tact having, in the opinion of
the Rabbins, been introduced for the purpose of doing honour to
circumcision.</p>

<p>This custom obtains in Egypt, even in our own day, for many
travellers assert that the Arabs, when desirous of saluting or
making a promise with great solemnity, place their hand upon the
part in question. A case in point is related in a letter of the
Ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id=
"Page_8">8</a></span>jutant-General Julian to a member of the
Institute of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> An Egyptian, who had
been arrested as a spy, and brought before the general, finding
that all his asservations of innocence could not be understood
"leva sa chemise bleue, et prenant son phallus &agrave; la
poign&eacute;e, resta un moment dans l'attitude th&eacute;atrale
d'un dieu jurant par le Styx. Sa physionomie semblait me dire:
<i>Apr&egrave;s la serment terrible que je fais pour vous prouver
mon innocence, osez-vous en douter?</i> Son geste me rappela que du
tems d'Abraham on jurait v&eacute;rit&eacute; en portant la main
aux organes de la g&eacute;n&eacute;ration." The vast antiquity of
this custom among the ancient Egyptians is proved by figure 2,
Plate IV. This figure, which is copied from Caylus, Vol. VI., Plate
I., figure 4, represents Osiris grasping his phallus while taking
an oath.</p>

<p>A custom greatly resembling this manner of swearing existed also
in the north of Europe, as is proved by an ancient law still
extant: thus, one of the articles of the Welsh laws enacted by
<i>Hoel the Good</i>, provides that, in cases of rape, if the woman
wishes to prosecute the offender, she must, when swearing to the
identity of the criminal, lay her right hand upon the relics of the
saints and grasp with her left one, the peccant member of the party
accused.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>It may be mentioned, <i>en passant</i>, that the low Irish in
Dublin, and the London costermongers, often make use of an
expression which, whether connected or not with the custom above
noted, offers for our consideration a curious coincidence at least.
If extra <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id=
"Page_9">9</a></span>force is to accompany an assertion, it is very
common for the vulgar to say in conclusion: "<i>S'elp my
taters!</i>" or "<i>So help me</i> <span class=
"smcap">testes</span>"&mdash;equal to saying, "<i>I swear by my
member.</i>" That the word "taters" is a corruption of, and
vulgarism for, "<i>testes</i>" we see very readily in the
expression "<i>strain my taters</i>"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to pass
urine or make water.</p>

<p>The Greeks had consecrated the same symbols of universal
fecundity in their mysteries, the phallus and the cteis being
publicly exhibited in the sanctuary of Eleusis. The <i>membrum
virile</i> or <i>active</i> principle of generation was carried to
the temple of Bacchus and there crowned with a garland by one of
the most respectable matrons of the town or city. The Egyptian
Osiris, and the female <i>pudenda</i>, or symbol of the
<i>passive</i> principle of generation were, in like manner,
carried in procession to the temple of Libera or Proserpine.</p>

<p>The worship of Priapus among the Romans was derived from the
Egyptians, who, under the form of Apis, the sacred Bull, worshipped
the generative power of nature; and, as the syllable <i>pri</i> or
<i>pre</i> signifies, in the Oriental tongue, <i>principle</i>,
production, or natural or original source, the word <i>Priapus</i>
may be translated <i>principle of production</i> or of
<i>fecundation of Apis</i>. The same symbol also bore among the
Romans the names of <i>Tutunus</i>, <i>Mutinus</i>, and
<i>Fascinum</i>. Among the many places where this divinity was
worshipped, Lampsacus,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> in Asia Minor, was the
most noted on account of the obscene rites there practised. The
Priapi were of different forms; some having only a human head <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>and the
Phallus; some with the head of Pan or of a faun&mdash;that is, with
the head and ears of a goat.<a name="FNanchor_16" id=
"FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
Others, with their indecent attribute, were placed in the public
roads, and were then confounded with the divinities <i>Mercury</i>
and <i>Terminus</i>, who presided over boundaries. Scaliger says
that he saw at Rome, in the palace of a cardinal,<a name=
"FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class=
"fnanchor">17</a> a similar statue, whose phallus had served as a
sign post.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> All the human part of these
Priapi were invariably painted red.<a name="FNanchor_19" id=
"FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class=
"fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>When furnished with arms, which he was when representing
Terminus, Priapus held in one hand a reaping hook, and, like
Osiris, grasped with the other the characteristic feature of his
divinity, which was always of a monstrous size and in a state of
energy.</p>

<p>In the towns, Priapus had public chapels, whither such devotees
as were suffering from maladies connected with his attributes
repaired for the purpose of offering to him <i>ex-votos</i>
representing the parts afflicted; these ex-votos being sometimes
paintings and, at others, little figures made of wax or of wood,
and occasionally, even of marble.</p>

<p>Females as superstitious, as they were lascivious, might be seen
offering in public to Priapus, as many garlands as they had had
lovers. These they would hang upon the enormous phallus of the
idol, which was often hidden from sight by the number suspended by
only one woman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id=
"Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>Others offered to the god as many phalli, made of the wood of
the willow tree, as they had vanquished men in a single night.</p>

<p>St. Augustine informs us that it was considered by the Roman
ladies as a very proper and pious custom to require young brides to
seat themselves upon the monstrous and obscene member of Priapus:
and Lactantius says, "Shall I speak of that <i>Mutinus</i>, upon
the extremity of which brides are accustomed to seat themselves in
order that the god may appear to have been the first to receive the
sacrifice of their modesty?"<a name="FNanchor_20" id=
"FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class=
"fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>These facts prove that the worship of Priapus had greatly
degenerated with the Romans, since, losing sight altogether of the
object typified, they attach themselves to the symbol alone, in
which they could see only what was indecent; and hence religion
became a pretext for libertinism.<a name="FNanchor_21" id=
"FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class=
"fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Respected so long as the Roman manners preserved their pristine
simplicity, but degraded<a name="FNanchor_22" id=
"FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
and vilified in proportion as the morals of that people became
corrupted, the very sanctuary itself of Priapus failed to protect
him from obloquy and ridicule. Christian writers added their
indignant invectives to the biting sarcasms of the poets, and the
worship of Priapus would have been annihilated had not superstition
and the force of habit, that most indestructible of all human
affections, come to the rescue. These two powerful levers of
mankind triumphed over reason <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>and Christianity, and
succeeded, notwithstanding the strenuous and continued efforts of
the latter, in maintaining in some degree the worship of that
filthy deity; for the Christian priests, while opposing <i>&agrave;
l'outrance</i>, the superstitions and impure practices already
adverted to, did not so do, as regarded the other customs equally
repugnant to decency and true religion. Less austere to these, and
consulting their own interests, they turned to their profit the
ancient worship established by the Romans and strengthened by
habit: they appropriated to themselves what they could not destroy,
and, in order to attract to their side the votaries of Priapus,
they made a Christian of him.</p>

<p>But besides the Lingham of the Indians, the Phallus of the
Greeks, and the Priapus of the Romans, the Cross (<img class=
"floatInsert" src="images/symbol_t.png" alt="symbol T" />),
although generally thought to be exclusively emblematical of
eternal life, has also an account of its fancied similarity to the
<i>membrum virile</i>, been considered by many as typical of the
reproductive powers of nature. It was known as such to the Indians,
being as common in their country as in Egypt or in Europe.<a name=
"FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class=
"fnanchor">23</a> "Let not the piety of the Catholic Christian,"
says the Rev. Mr. Maurice, "be offended at the preceding assertion
that the Cross was one of the most usual symbols among the
hieroglyphics of Egypt and India. Equally honoured in the Gentile
and the world, this Christian emblem of universal nature, of that
world to whose four corners its diverging radii pointed, decorated
the hands of most of the sculptured images in the former country
(Egypt), and the latter (India) stamped its form upon the most
majestic of the shrines of their deities."</p>

<p>It is well known that the cross was regarded by the ancient
Egyptians as the emblem of fruitfulness. Thus the Rev. Mr. <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>Maurice
describes a statue bearing a kind, of cross in its hand as the
symbol of fertility, or, in other words, of the procreative and
generative powers.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a
href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> The cross <img class=

upon Egyptian monuments was known to the Buddhists and to the Lama
of Thibet 700 years before Christ. The Lama takes his name from the
<i>Lamah</i>, which is an object of profound veneration with his
followers: "Cequi est remarquable," says M. Avril, "c'est que le
grand pr&ecirc;tre des Tartares porte le nom de Lama, qui, en
langue Tartare, d&eacute;signe <i>la Croix</i>, et les Bogdoi qui
conquirent la Chine en 1664, et qui sont soumis au Dulai-Lama dans

<p>The letter <i>Tau</i> <img class="floatInsert" src=
"images/symbol_t.png" alt="symbol T" />, being the last one of the
ancient alphabets, was made to typify, not only the end, boundary,
or terminus of districts, but also the generative power of the
eternal transmigratory life, and was used indiscriminately with the
Phallus; it was, in fact, the Phallus.<a name="FNanchor_26" id=
"FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
Speaking of this emblem, Payne Knight observes: "One of the most
remarkable of those symbols of generation is a cross in the form of
the letter <img class="floatInsert" src="images/symbol_t.png" alt=
"symbol T" />, which thus served as the emblem of <i>creation</i>
and <i>generation</i> before the church adopted it as the sign of
salvation, a lucky coincidence of ideas which, without doubt,
facilitated the reception of it among the faithful."<a name=
"FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class=

sometimes represented by signs of the same sort, which might
properly be called symbols of symbols. One of the most
remarkable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id=
"Page_14">14</a></span> of these is the Cross in the form of the
letter <img class="floatInsert" src="images/symbol_t.png" alt=

to by the Prophet Ezekiel,<a name="FNanchor_30" id=

and is affirmed by the learned L. A. Crozius to be nothing else
than the triple Phallus mentioned by Plutarch.<a name="FNanchor_31"
id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class=
"fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>We shall now proceed to notice a few of the traces of the
phallic worship as were still to be found lingering in some parts
of Europe so late as the 18th century, a tenacity of existence by
no means surprising if it be considered that of all the human
affections none is more dangerous to oppose, none more difficult to
eradicate, than habit. Accordingly it will be found that the above
superstition has maintained itself in countries where Christianity
was already established, and that, bidding defiance to the severe
precepts of that pure faith, it successfully resisted for at least
seventeen centuries every effort made to extirpate it by the
Christian clergy backed by the civil power. Its triumph was,
however, by no means complete, for this worship was constrained to
yield to circumstances and to use a disguise by adopting the forms
and designations peculiar to Christianity, a mask which on the
other hand, favoured not a little, its preservation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id=
"Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>Hence it was that the names of certain legendary saints were
given to the ancient God of Lampsacus,<a name="FNanchor_32" id=
"FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
the said names having some relation either to the act over which
that deity presided, or to his most prominent attributes.</p>

<p>The first bishop of Lyon was honoured throughout Provence,
Languedoc, and the Lyonnais as a saint, and as his name happened to
be Pothin, Photin, or Fotin, commonly pronounced by the low orders
<i>Foutin</i>, these people, who are very apt to judge of the
nature of things by the sound of the words by which they are
designated, thought St. Foutin worthy of replacing Saint Priapus,
and accordingly conferred upon him the prerogatives of his
predecessor.</p>

<p>Saint <i>Foutin de Varailles</i> had particular reverence paid
to him in Provence, nor is this to be wondered at, since the power
was attributed to him of rendering barren women fruitful,
stimulating flagging husbands, and curing their secret maladies. It
was consequently the custom to lay upon his altar, as was formerly
done on that of the god Priapus, small votive offerings, made of
wax, and representing the weak or otherwise afflicted parts. Sanci
says, "To this saint are offered waxen models of the <i>pudenda</i>
of both sexes. They are strewn in great numbers over the floor of
the chapel, and should a gust of wind cause them to rustle against
one another, it occasioned a serious interruption to the devotions
paid to the saint. I was very much scandalized," <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>continues he,
"when, passing through the town, I found the name of <i>Foutin</i>
very common among the men. My landlord's daughter had for godmother
a young lady whose name was <i>Foutine</i>."</p>

<p>The same saint was similarly honoured at Embrun. When the
Protestants took that town in 1585, they found, among the relics of
the principal church, the <i>Phallus</i> of St. Foutin. The
devotees of that town, in imitation of pagan ones, made libations
to this obscene idol. They poured wine over the extremity of the
Phallus, which was dyed red by it. This wine being afterwards
collected and allowed to turn sour, was called <i>the holy
vinegar</i>, and, according to the author from whom this account is
taken,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> was applied by women to a
most extraordinary purpose; but what that purpose was we are not
informed, and therefore can only guess it.</p>

<p>At Orange there was also a phallus much venerated by the
inhabitants of that town. Larger than the one at Embrun, it was,
moreover, covered with leather, and furnished with its appendages.
When, in 1562, the protestants destroyed the church of St.
Eutropius, in this town, they seized the enormous Phallus and
burned it in the market place. Similar Phalli were to be found at
Poligny, Vendre in the Bourbonnais, and at Auxerre.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Puy-en-Velay even to this day speak of their
St. <i>Foustin</i> who, in times not far remote from our own, was
invoked by barren women who, under the idea of giving greater
efficacy to their prayers, scraped the phallus of the saint, and,
mixing the particles so abraded in water, devoutly swallowed them,
in the hope of thereby being rendered fruitful.</p>

<p>It is no doubt to one of these phallic saints that Count de
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id=
"Page_17">17</a></span>Gebelin refers when, speaking of the goat
<i>Mend&eacute;s</i>, he says: "I have read somewhere that in the
south of France there existed not long ago a custom resembling the
one mentioned; the women of that part of the country devoutly
frequented a temple containing a statue of the saint, and which
statue they embraced, expecting that their barrenness would be
removed by the operation.<a name="FNanchor_34" id=
"FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class=
"fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Brest stood the chapel of the famous
Saint Guignole, or Guingalais, whose Phallic symbol consisted of a
long wooden beam which passed right through the body of the saint,
and the fore-part of which was strikingly characteristic. The
devotees of this place, like those of Puy-en-Velay, most devoutly
rasped the extremity of this miraculous symbol for the purpose of
drinking the scrapings mixed with water as an antidote against
sterility, and when by the frequent repetition of this operation,
the beam was worn away, a blow with a mallet in the rear of the
saint propelled it immediately in front. Thus, although it was
being continually scraped, it appeared never to diminish, a miracle
due exclusively to the mallet.</p>

<p>Antwerp was the Lampsacus of Belgium, Priapus being the tutelary
god of that city. <i>Ters</i> was the name given to him by the
inhabitants who held this divinity in the greatest veneration.
Females were accustomed to invoke him on the most trivial
occasions, a custom which Goropius informs us continued as late as
the 16th century.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a
href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>So inveterate was this superstition that Godefrey de Bouillon,
marquis of that city, the illustrious leader of the first crusade,
in order to eradicate it, or to replace it by the ceremonies of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Christian church, sent to Antwerp, from Jerusalem, as a present of
inestimable value, the <i>foreskin of Jesus Christ</i>.<a name=
"FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class=
"fnanchor">36</a> This precious relic, however, found but little
favour with the Belgian ladies, and utterly failed to supersede
their beloved <i>Fascinum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_37" id=
"FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class=
"fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>In the kingdom of Naples, in the town of Trani, the capital of
the province of that name, there was carried in procession, during
the Carnival, an old wooden statue representing an entire Priapus,
in the ancient proportions; that is to say, that the distinguishing
characteristic of that god was very disproportioned to the rest of
the idol's body, reaching, as it did, to the height of his chin.
The people called this figure <i>il Santo Membro</i>, the holy
member. This ancient ceremony, evidently a remains of the feasts of
Bacchus, called by the Greeks <i>Dyonysiacs</i>, and by the Romans
<i>Liberalia</i>, existed as late as the commencement of the 18th
century, when it was abolished by Joseph Davanzati, archbishop of
that town.</p>

<p>Sir W. Hamilton's account of the worship paid to St. Cosmo and
St. Damianus is very curious. "On the 27th September, at Isernia,
one of the most ancient cities of the kingdom of Naples, situated
in the province called the Contado di Molise, and adjoining the
Aruzzo, an annual fair is held which lasts three days. On one of
the days of the fair the relics of Sts. Cosmo and Damianus are
exposed. In the city and at the fair, <i>ex-votos</i> of wax
representing the male parts of generation, of various dimensions,
sometimes even of the length of a palm, are publicly <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>exposed for
sale. There was also waxen vows that represent other parts of the
body mixed with them, but of those there are few in comparison of
the number of the Priapi.</p>

<p>The distributors of these vows carry a basket full of them in
one hand, and hold a plate in the other, to receive the money,
crying out, "Saints Cosmo and Damianus!" If you ask the price of
one, the answer is, "<i>pi&ugrave; ci metti, pi&ugrave;
meriti</i>;" the more you give, the more the merit. The vows are
chiefly presented by the female sex, and they are seldom such as
represent legs, arms, &amp;c., but most commonly the male parts of
generation. The person who was at the <i>f&eacute;te</i>, in the
year 1780, and who gave me this account (the authenticity of which
has since been confirmed to me by the governer of Isernia) told me
also that he heard a woman say, at the time she presented a vow,
"<i>Santo Cosmo, benedetto, cosi lo voglio</i>." Blessed St. Cosmo,
"let it be like this!" The vow is never presented without being
accompanied by a piece of money, and is always kissed by the
devotee at the moment of presentation.<a name="FNanchor_38" id=
"FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class=
"fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>But, as might naturally be expected, this does not suffice to
fructify barren women; and consequently another ceremony, one which
is doubtless more efficacious, was required.</p>

<p>The parties who resort to this fair, slept for two nights, some
in the church of the Capuchian friars and the others in that of the
Cordeliers, and when these two churchs were found to be <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id=
"Page_20">20</a></span>insufficient to contain the whole of such
devotees, the church of the Hermitage of St. Cosmo received the
surplus.</p>

<p>In the three edifices, the women were during the two nights,
separated from the men, the latter lying under the vestibule, and
the women, in the church, these, whether in the church of the
Capuchins or in that of the Cordeliers, were under the protection
of the Father guardian, the vicar, and a monk of merit. In the
hermitage, it was the hermit himself who watched over them.</p>

<p>From this it may easily be imagined how the miracle was effected
without troubling Saint Cosmo and Saint Damianus at all, in the
matter, as well as that the virtue, possessed by those two saints
was extended even to young maidens and widows.</p>

<h4>ESSAY II.</h4>

<h4>ANAPHRODISIA; OR, ABSENCE OF THE REPRODUCTIVE POWER.</h4>

<p><img src="images/ill_a.png" class="floatLeft" alt=
"A" />DESCRIPTION of the symbols under which the <i>reproductive
power</i> was anciently worshipped, having been given in the
preceding Essay, the present one will contain some account of the
<i>negation</i> or <i>absence</i> of that faculty, whether total or
partial, as known under the names of <i>Impotency</i> and
<i>Sterility</i>.</p>

<p>Potency or power, as regards the generative act, may be defined
as&mdash;the aptitude or ability to beget; and Impotency, the
negation or absence of such power.</p>

<p>The canon law distinguished three kinds of impotency&mdash;viz.,
that which proceeds from frigidity; that which is caused by sorcery
(ligature or point-tying), and that which proceeding from some
defect of conformation is properly designated as <i>impotentia
coeundi</i>. The different lends of impotency may be thus
classed&mdash;1. Those which are proper to men; 2. Those proper to
women, and 3. Those common to both sexes.<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>The causes of impotency proper to man are natural frigidity;
defect of conformation, and accident.</p>

<p>The causes of impotency proper to women are all such obstacles
as arise <i>ex clausur&acirc; uteri aut nimia arctitudine</i>.</p>

<p>The causes common both to men and women are the defect of
puberty and imperfect conformation.<a name="FNanchor_39" id=
"FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class=
"fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>Impotency may also be divided into natural and accidental; the
former being that which a person is born with, or which proceeds
<i>ex vitio naturalis temperamenti vel partium genitalium</i>; and
the latter that which arises from some accident, as <i>ex casu vel
morbo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>Another definition of impotency in man is the <i>non posse
seminare in vase idoneo</i>; three things being considered as
indispensable to his due performance of the generative
act.&mdash;<i>Ut arriget</i> or erection; 2, <i>Ut vas
f&oelig;mineum resaret</i>, or intromission, and 3, <i>Ut in vase
seminat</i>, or emission.</p>

<p>Sterility must not be confounded with impotency. Many women are
barren, but very few are impotent; while, on the contrary, many men
are impotent who ought not, on that account, to be regarded as
barren. In either sex impotency is present when from whatever cause
an individual cannot concur in the sexual contact. Sterility exists
when the contact, after having been regularly accomplished, is
followed by no productive result.</p>

<p>With the exception of those pathological cases in which
deformities are sometimes, but very rarely, met with, it may be
affirmed that woman is never impotent, for her organization opposes
it. Radical impotence, in fact, results in the female from the
complete absence, or the occlusion simply, of the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>vagina. Now,
these cases are extremely rare, and may there fore be considered as
exceptions or as real monstrosities.</p>

<p>As the causes of sterility in women are numerous and of various
kinds, we shall briefly enumerate them.</p>

<p>The absence of ovaries or their deceased state are the radical
cause of sterility. These causes may be suspected but not cured.
When there is no uterus, still fecundation and pregnancy are not
impossible, since extra-uterine pregnancies are occasionally
observed, that is to say, cases in which the product of conception
has escaped the uterus, and proceeded to establish itself in some
point of the lower belly. Neither is the vagina indispensable, for
cases are cited of the contraction of this organ accompanied by the
rectovaginal fistula, in which fecundation is effected, although
the fecundating fluid had been confined to the rectum.</p>

<p>Female masturbation is another rife cause of barrenness in
women. If it be true that the number of eggs is limited, and that
there are not more than from 15 to 20 in each ovary, it is evident
that sterility must ensue when these 15 or 20 eggs have been
detached without fecundation. If, on the contrary, new eggs are
continually secreted by the ovaries, it is equally evident that the
secretory action must, sooner or later, become exhausted by the
over excitement caused by the indulgence above mentioned.</p>

<p>Another very great cause of sterility, and which must be of
frequent occurrence, is found in the obstructed or choked-up state
of the Fallopian tubes. These passages, which establish the
communication between the ovary and the uterus, may be obstructed
by inflammation, either acute or chronic, to which they must be
subject in all diseases to the abdomen, as well as by frequent
excitement.</p>

<p>Morgagni speaks of certain women of the town, with whom<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> the
Fallopian tubes were completely obliterated by the thickening of
the parietes or sides, an evident consequence of the continual
orgasm in which they were kept by immoderate indulgence in
coition.</p>

<p>The absence of menstruation almost always induces barrenness.
Cases are, notwithstanding, reported in which women have their
menses during pregnancy, but these are exceptions which so far from
invalidating the rule, confirm it.</p>

<p>Polypi, or the developement of fibrous bodies in the uterus,
present an equal obstacle to fecundation, their presence having the
effect of perverting the physiological functions of the uterus, nor
does their removal always cause sterility to disappear.</p>

<p>Impotency in women can only result from the absence of the
vagina, or from its excessive narrowness which does not allow of
the approach of the male, although instances have occured of
fecundation being effected without the introduction of the male
organ. Thus cases have been found of women who have been
fecundated, and have even arrived at the term of pregnancy, having
been obliged to submit to a surgical operation for the removal of
the Hymen, which membrane had not been broken in the acts which had
nevertheless effected the fecundation. Lastly, the excessive
length, when it does exist, of the clitoris, also opposes the
conjugal act, by the difficulty it presents to the introduction of
the fecundating organ; the only remedy to employed in this case
consists in amputation, an operation which has been frequently
performed. The organ in question is known to resemble, in a very
great degree, the virile member, both in external form and internal
structure, to be susceptible of erection and relaxation and
endowned with exquisite sensibility. It has been seen equal to the
penis in volume.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id=
"Page_25">25</a></span> A remarkable instance is given by Home.<a
name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"
class="fnanchor">41</a> It occured in a negress who was purchased
by General Melville, in the island of Dominica, in the West Indies,
about the year 1744. She was of the Mandango nation, 24 years of
age, her breasts were very flat, she had a rough voice, and a
masculine countenance. The clitoris was two inches long, and in
thickness resembled a common sized thumb, when viewed at same
distance the end appeared round and of a red colour, but upon
closer examination was found to be more pointed than that of a
penis, and having neither prepuce nor perforation; when handled it
became half erected, and was in that state fully three inches long
and much thicker than before: when she voided her urine she was
obliged to lift it up, as it completely covered the orifice of the
urethra. The other parts of the female organs were found to be in a
natural state. Columbus quotes the existence of a woman who had a
clitoris as long as the little finger. Haller speaks of another in
whom this organ was seven inches in length. Some have even been
said to be of the monstrous length of twelve inches. These are the
enormous dimensions which sometimes deceive as to the real
character of the sex, and which have occasioned a belief in the
existence of real hermaphrodites. Women so formed have also a great
disposition to usurp the virile functions; they preserve scarcely
anything of their sex except their habits and manners. Their
stature is in general tall, their limbs muscular, their face
masculine, their voice deep, and their deportment bold and
manly&mdash;in a word, they completely justify the words of
Martial:</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id=

<p>In the case of man's impotency it often happens, on the
contrary, that, with organs to all appearance perfectly formed, he
is, nevertheless, impotent.</p>

<p>If the woman be organized for receiving, the man is formed for
imparting; now, in the majority, of cases, his impotency is such
that, although he seems to be provided with abundant stores he is
precluded from offering them.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i13">... "Si</span> <span class=

id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class=
"fnanchor">43</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Such, in fact, is the great difficulty of those individuals who
have abused their organs and destroyed their sensibility. The
erectile tissue whose turgescence is indispensable, no longer
admits into its vascular <i>plexus</i> or network, a quantity of
fluid sufficient to give the organ the power of
penetrating&mdash;<i>jacet exiguus</i>&mdash;and, although it may
be supposed that the seminal glands perform their functions
perfectly well, and secrete abundantly the fluid peculiar to them,
the copulative organ remains paralyzed. This is the impotence which
is brought on by old age, and which Ariosto has so forcibly
described in the following lines, wherein he relates the futile
attempts made upon Angelica by the hermit:</p>

</div>

<p>At other times the impotency of the man is independent of the
secretion of the fecundating fluid and even of the erection, both
of which are regular. In such case it is caused either by the gland
not being properly perforated, or by a contraction of the urethral
canal, which contraction arrests the seminal fluid at the moment of
expulsion, causing it to flow back towards the bladder, or else
intercepting the continuous stream and allowing it to run by
dribblets only. The former of these imperfections technically
called <i>Hypospadias</i> is a vice of conformation in which the
penis, instead of being perforated at the summit of the gland,
presents its opening at a greater or less distance from the gland,
at the lower part of the urethra or at the
<i>perin&aelig;um</i>.</p>

<p>As might be expected, impotency when precocious, influences, in
no small degree, the moral character. Cabanis knew three men who,
in the vigour of age, had suddenly became impotent, although in
other respects they were in good health, much engaged in business,
and had but little reason to be affected by the loss of pleasures
in which they indulged but very rarely and with great moderation,
yet their character became gloomy and irascible, and their mental
powers appeared to diminish daily.<a name="FNanchor_45" id=
"FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
The celebrated Ribeiro Sanchez, a pupil of Boerhaave, observes in
his "<i>Trait&eacute; des maladies V&eacute;n&eacute;riennes
chroniques</i>," that these <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28">28</a></span>diseases particularly dispose those
subject to them to superstitious terrors.</p>

<p>Impotency may, however, equally proceed from moral as from
physical causes. In this case it consists in the total privation of
the sensibility peculiar to the reproductive organs. This
insensibility is by no means infrequent in persons whose mental
powers are continually in action, as the following case will
shew:&mdash;</p>

<p>A celebrated mathematician of a very robust constitution, having
married a young and pretty woman, lived several years with her, but
had not the happiness of becoming a father. Far from being
insensible to the charms of his fair wife, he, on the contrary,
felt frequently impelled to gratifying his passion, but the
conjugal act, complete in every other respect, was never crowned by
the emission of the seminal fluid. The interval of time which
occurred between the commencement of his labour of love and the end
was always sufficiently long to allow his mind, which had been for
a moment abstracted by his pleasure, to be brought back to the
constant objects of his meditation&mdash;that is, to geometrical
problems or algebraical formula. At the very moment even of the
orgasm, the intellectual powers resumed their empire and all
genital sensation vanished. Peirible, his medical adviser,
recommended Madame &mdash;&mdash; never to suffer the attentions of
her husband until he was <i>half-seas-over</i>, this appearing to
him the only practicable means of withdrawing her learned spouse
from influence of the divine Urania and subjecting him more
immediately to that of the seductive goddess of Paphos. The advice
proved judicious. Monsieur &mdash;&mdash; became the father of
several fine and healthy boys and girls, thus furnishing another
proof of the truth of the maxim, "<i>Sine Cerere et Baccho friget
Venus</i>."</p>

<p>But the impotency arising from the predominance of the intellect
is the least formidable of all. The one most to be dreaded is<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span> that
which results from the excessive and premature exercise of the
reproductive functions, for, as has been well observed, "the too
frequent indulgence of a natural propensity at first increases the
concomitant desire and makes its gratification a part of the
periodical circle of action; but by degrees the over excitement of
the organs, abating their tone and vitality, unfits them for the
discharge of their office, the accompanying pleasures are blunted,
and give place to satiety and disgust."<a name="FNanchor_46" id=
"FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class=
"fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>Such unfortunate persons as are the victims of this kind of
anaphrodisia become old long before their natural time, and have
all their generative apparatus blasted with impotency. Their
testicles withered and dried up secrete nothing but a serous fluid
void of all virtue; the erectile tissue no longer admits into its
plexus the quantum of blood necessary for turgescence, the
principal organ of the reproductive act remains in a state of
flaccidity, insensible to the reiterated and most stimulating
solicitations; the muscles destined to favour erection are stricken
with paralysis, and the violence of their desires, joined to the
want of power to gratify them, drives the unhappy victim to acts of
the most revolting lubricity and thence to despair.</p>

<p>An instance of this kind occurred in the case of a young man,
the son of an opulent family. He had arrived at puberty, but from
the early age of ten had been accustomed to indulge in indecent
familiarities with young girls, who had gratified him by lascivious
manipulations; the consequence was an entire loss of the erectile
power. Travelling being recommended, he proceeded to France, where
he consulted, but without avail, several celebrated physicians. He
then went to the waters of Spa, and there his case was attentively
and anxiously considered by Van-Hers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id=
"Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>The sensibility and weakness of the genital member were so great
that on the slightest touch, and without any sensation or desire to
sexual intercourse the young man emitted a fluid similar to whey.
This secretion continued night and day, every time that he made
water, or upon the slightest friction of his linen. After various
remedies being proposed, without any beneficial results, Van-Hers
considered the disease as incurable; but, as the patient would not
coincide in his opinion and was very rich, he continued his travels
in Italy, France, and Germany, in the hope of recovering his powers
of virility. He failed not, as usual, to meet with physicians who,
from mercenary motives, held out to him the most illusory prospects
of a perfect cure. At length, after six years passed in travelling
and in vain attempts to regain the generative faculty, he returned
to the candid and able physician from whom he had the truth, and
whose opinion he was now convinced was but too well founded. As may
be supposed, Van-Hers perceived no new circumstance to justify an
alteration in his view of the case, and the unfortunate young man
returned home, deeply deploring the advantages of a fortune which
had made him the victim of the precocious abuse of pleasures to
which he must now bid adieu for ever.<a name="FNanchor_47" id=
"FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
Too great warmth of passion may not only defeat its own object, but
also produce a temporary impotency. A lover, after having, with all
the ardour of affections, longed for the enjoyment of his mistress,
finds himself at the moment of fruition incapable of consummating
his happiness. The only remedy for this misfortune is to allay the
over-excitement and to restrain the exuberance of the imagination.
It would be madness to persist in endeavouring to obtain a victory
which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id=
"Page_31">31</a></span>must be certain, as soon as the heat of the
animal spirits being abated, a portion of them proceeds to animate
the agents of voluptuous passion. The following are cases of this
description.</p>

<p>"A young man whose wife's relations had promised him a
considerable estate as soon as she proved to be pregnant, fatigued
himself to no purpose by continued devotions at the shrine of love;
his over anxiety defeating the very object he so ardently desired
to accomplish. In despair at the failure of his repeated efforts,
he was, at length, on the point of believing his wife barren, when,
following the advice of a judicious physician, he absented himself
from home for a fortnight, and upon his return proved by the
success which attended his amorous labours, that absence is
sometimes the best doctor."</p>

<p>"A noble Venetian, aged twenty years, was married to a very
handsome lady, with whom he cohabited with a good deal of vigour,
but never could emit semen in the coition, whereas in his dreams he
could discharge very freely. This misfortune very much afflicted
him and his family; and as no remedy could be found at home, the
Venetian ambassadors residing at the different courts of Europe
were desired to consult some of the most eminent physicians in the
cities where they resided, to account for the causes, and to find a
cure for this extraordinary complaint of the difference of the
states when in sleep and when actually in coition.</p>

<p>"I was of opinion that it consisted altogether in the urethra
being closely shut by the vigour of the erection in coition which
found so great a resistance that the powers that throw the seed out
of the <i>vesicul&aelig; seminals</i> could not overcome it;
whereas, in dreams, the pressure on the urethra being much less, an
evacuation was affected."</p>

<p>The method of cure was not less successful than obvious
from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id=
"Page_32">32</a></span> the foregoing account: for gentle
evacuations and a slender diet brought about and fully completed
their desires.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href=

<p>Cabanis is of opinion that debility of the stomach almost always
produces a similar state in the organs of generation.
"L'&eacute;nergie ou la d&eacute;bilit&eacute; de l'&eacute;stomac
produit, presque toujours, un &eacute;tat analogue dans ceux de la
g&eacute;n&eacute;ration. J'ai soign&eacute; un jeune homme chez
qui la paralysie accidentelle de ces derniers avait
&eacute;t&eacute; produit par certains vices de la digestion
stomachique; et qui reprit la vigueur de son &acirc;ge,
aussit&ocirc;t qu'il e&ucirc;t r&eacute;couvr&eacute; la puissance
de dig&eacute;rer."<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a

<p>Old Montaigne's advice in cases similar to those above cited is
worthy of notice. "As to what concerns married people," says he,
"having the year before them, they ought never to compel, or so
much as offer at the feat, if they do not find themselves very
ready. And it is better indecently to fail of handling the nuptial
sheets, and of paying the ceremony due to the wedding night, when
man perceives himself full of agitation and trembling, expecting
another opportunity at a better and more private leisure, when his
fancy shall be better composed, than to make himself perpetually
miserable for having misbehaved himself, and being baffled at the
first result. Till possession be taken, a man that knows himself
subject to this infirmity, should leisurely and by degrees make
certain little trials and light offers, without attempting at once
to force an absolute conquest over his own mutinous and indisposed
faculties; such as know their members to be naturally obedient to
their desires, need to take no other care but only to counterplot
their fancy. The indocile <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33">33</a></span>and rude liberty of this scurvy member,
is sufficiently remarkable by its importunate, unruly, and
unseasonable tumidity and impatience at such times as we have
nothing for it to do, and by its most unseasonable stupidity and
disobedience when we stand most in need of its vigour, so
imperiously contesting the authority of the will, and with so much
obstinacy denying all solicitations of hand and fancy. And yet,
though his rebellion is so universally complained of, and that
proofs are not wanting to condemn him, if he had, nevertheless,
feed me to plead his cause, I should, peradventure, bring the rest
of his fellow-members into suspicion of complotting the mischief
against him, out of pure envy of the importance and ravishing
pleasure peculiar to his employment, so as to have, by confederacy,
armed the whole world against him, by malevolently charging him
alone with their common offence."<a name="FNanchor_50" id=
"FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class=
"fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Too great warmth of clothing round the parts of generation, or
too great pressure upon them, may be reckoned as causes of
impotency. The custom of wearing breeches was considered by
Hippocrates<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> as a predisposing cause of
the impotency so common among the ancient Scythians. Mr. Hunter was
also of opinion that this article of dress by keeping the parts too
warm, affording them a constant support, and allowing the muscles
but little freedom of motion, may, at least, relax and cause them
to become flaccid, if it do not totally incapacitate them for the
due performance of their functions.</p>

<p>Equally disadvantageous, in this respect, is the practice of
riding upon horseback, as the organs of generation are, of
necessity, frequently compressed either against the saddle or the
horse's back. Lalemant, in his Commentaries upon Hippocrates,
adduces <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id=
"Page_34">34</a></span>the case of bakers, upon whom, by their not
wearing breeches, the contrary effect is produced. "We have often
heard," says he, "that bakers and others whose parts of generation
are not covered by clothing, but hang freely, have large,
well-grown testicles.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a
href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Another cause of impotency is the allowing the parts of
generation to remain too long in a state of inaction. Those parts
of the body which are most exercised are always found to be better
grown, stronger, and more fitted for the discharge of their natural
functions provided the exercise be neither too violent nor too
frequent. The parts, on the contrary, which are condemned to rest
and inactivity wither and gradually lose their tone, as well as the
power of effecting the movements natural to them. Galen observes
that the genital organs of the athlet&aelig;, as well as those of
all such whose profession or calling compelled them to remain
chaste, were generally shrunken and wrinkled like those of old men,
and that the contrary is the case with those who use them to an
excess. "All the athlet&aelig;," says he, "as well as those who for
the sake of preserving or improving the voice, are, from their
youth, debarred the pleasures of love, have their natural parts
shrunken and wrinkled like those of old men, while, in such as have
from an early age indulged in those delights to an excess, the
vessel of those parts, by the habit of being dilated, cause the
blood to flow there in great abundance, and the desire of coition
to be proportionately increased, all which is a natural consequence
of those general laws which all our faculties obey. Thus it is that
the breasts of women who have never had children remain always
small, while those of females who have been mothers, and who suckle
their children, acquire a considerable <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>volume, that they continue
to give milk as long as they suckle their infants, and that their
milk does not fail until they cease to nourish them."<a name=
"FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class=
"fnanchor">53</a> So well, indeed, was this fact known to the
ancients, that Aristophanes uses the expression,
&pi;&#8057;&sigma;&theta;&eta;&nu;
&mu;&iota;&kappa;&rho;&alpha;&nu;, <i>penem exiguum</i>, as an
attribute of a youth who has preserved his innocence and
&kappa;&omega;&lambda;&#8134;&nu;
&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&#8049;&lambda;&eta;&nu;, <i>penem magnum</i>,
as the sign of a dissolute one.</p>

<p>It will easily be supposed that superstition when brought to act
upon weak and ignorant minds, is capable of producing temporary
impotence. The pretended charm or witchery common in France as late
as the close of the 17th century, and known by the name of <i>nouer
l'aiguillette</i> (point tying) is a proof of this:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Ami lecteur, vous avez

<p>In olden times, prior to the invention of buttons, the femoral
habiliments of men, or hose, as they were called, were fastened up
by means of tags or points (Gallice) <i>aiguillettes</i>. Thus,
Falstaff says, "Their points being cut, down fell their hose."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
From this French word <i>aiguillette</i> was derived the term
<i>nouer aiguillette</i> (to tie up the points), equivalent
to&mdash;button up the flap, to express the rendering, by
enchantment, a husband incapable of performing the conjugal rite.
The whole secret of this charm consisted in the impostor choosing
for his victim an individual whose youth, inexperience, or
superstition presented him with a fit subject to work upon. The
imagination of the party being already predisposed for the trick, a
look, a sign, a menace, either of the voice or of the hand,
accompanied by some extraordinary gesture, was sufficient to
produce the effect, and, as the mere apprehension of an evil
frequently occasions its occurrence, it followed that, superstition
having prepared the event, the latter, in his turn, fortified the
superstition, a vicious circle which may justly be considered an
opprobrium to a man's intelligence.</p>

<p>That such was the opinion entertained of it by sensible men when
it was in vogue, will be seen by the following curious passage from
an old and quaint French writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Quelques uns tiennent cela pour superstition, qui quand on dit
la Messe des espous&eacute;es, lorsque l'on prononce ce mot
<i>Sara</i>, &agrave; la b&eacute;n&eacute;diction nuptiale, si

<p>As to the mode itself of conjuration, Bodin, a writer upon these
subjects, asserts that there are not less than fifty different ways
of performing it: of all which the most efficacious one is to take
a small strip or thong of leather, or silken or worsted thread, or
cotton cord, and to make on it three knots successively, each knot,
when made, being accompanied by the sign of the cross, the word
<i>Ribald</i> being pronounced upon making the first knot,
<i>Nabal</i> upon making the second one, and <i>Vanarbi</i> upon
making the third and last one; all which must be done during the
celebration of the marriage ceremony. For the sake of change, one
of the verses of the <i>Miserere mei, Deus!</i> may be repeated
backwards, the names of the bride and bridegroom being thrice
pronounced. The first time, the knot must be drawn rather tight;
the second time still more so, and the third time quite close.
Vulgar operators content themselves with pronouncing some
cabalistic words during the marriage rite, tracing, at the same
time, some mysterious figures or diagrams on the earth with the
left foot, and affixing to the dress of the bride or bridegroom
small slips of paper having magical characters inscribed upon them.
Further details may be found in the works of Sprenger, an
inquisitor, Crespet of Sans, Debris, a Jesuit, Bodin, Wier, De
Lancre, and other learned demonologists.</p>

<p>This species of enchantment was not unknown to the ancients.

Amasis was prevented enjoying his wife Ladice by a sorcery of this

Venus, "<i>si secum coiret Amasis</i>," that the king's wishes and
her own were gratified.</p>

<p>Of that most detestable of all tyrants, Nero, it is said that,
finding he could not enjoy a female whom he passionately desired,
he complained of having been bewitched.</p>

<p>Paulus (Julius) of Tyr states that the law of the Twelve Tables

ligatures; "qui, sacra, impia nocturnave fecerint, ut quem

<p>Gregory of Tours relates<a name="FNanchor_63" id=
"FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
that Eulatius having taken a young <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span> woman from a monastery and
married her, his concubines, actuated by jealousy, put such a spell
upon him, that he could by no means consummate his nuptials. Paulus
&AElig;milius, in his life of King Clovis says that Theodoric sent
back his wife Herm&eacute;berge to her father, the King of Spain,
as he had received her, a pure virgin, the force of witchcraft
having incapacitated him from taking her maidenhead; which sorcery
Aimoinus Monachaus<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a
href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> asserts to have been
effected by Queen Brunchante.</p>

<p>The practise of point tying was formerly so general that princes
and princess made it one of their most amusing pastimes. Louis
Sforza having seen the young Princess Isabella, daughter of
Alphonso King of Arragon, and who was betrothed to Galeas, duke of
Milan, was so enamoured of her beauty that he point-tyed Galeas for
several months. Marie de Padille, concubine of Don Pedro King of
Castille and Leon, point-tied him so effectually that he could not
give the least marks of his fondness to his consort Queen
Blanche.</p>

<p>That the church acknowledged the power of these point-tiers is
proved by the fact of their having been publicly anathematized by
the provincial Councils of Milan and Tours, the Synods of
Mont-Cassin and Ferriare, and by the clergy of France assembled at
M&eacute;lun in 1579. A great number of rituals specify the means
to be employed as counter-charms to the sorceries of the
point-tiers; and the Cardinal Cu Perron,<a name="FNanchor_65" id=
"FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> a
very able and experienced prelate, has inserted in the ritual of
Evreux very sage directions for this purpose. Similar precautions
may be found in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id=
"Page_40">40</a></span>synodal statues of Lyons, Tours, Sens,
Narbonne, Bourges, Troyes, Orl&eacute;ans, and many other
celebrated churches. St. Augustine, St. Thomas and Peter Lombard
positively recognise the power of point-tying and of disturbing, in
this manner, married persons in the enjoyment of their dearest
privilege. "<i>Certum est</i>," says St. Augustine, "<i>corporis
vires incantationibus vinciri</i>."</p>

<p>Our James I., who prided himself so much upon his skill in
demonology, declares positively that sorcerers and witches possess
the power of point-tying, "Or else by staying married folkes, to
have naturally adoe with other, <i>by knitting knottes upon a point
at the time of their marriage</i>."<a name="FNanchor_66" id=
"FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class=
"fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>The old parliament of France have generally admitted the power
of these sorcerers. In 1582 the Parliament of Paris condemned one
Abel de la Rue to be hung and afterwards burnt for having wickedly
and wilfully point-tied Jean Moreau de Contommiers. A singular
sentence was pronounced in 1597 against M. Chamouillard for having
so bewitched a young lady about to be married that her husband
could not consummate the marriage. But the most singular instance
of the kind upon record is that of R. F. Vidal de la Porte, who was
condemned by the judges of Riom to make the <i>amende
honorable</i>, and afterwards to be hung, and his lady to be burnt
until reduced to ashes for having by sorceries and wicked and
sacrilegious words point-tied, not only the young men of his town,
but also all the dogs, cats and other domestic animals, so that the
propagation of these species so useful to man was upon the point of
being stopped. In 1718 the Parliament of Bordeaux ordered a famous
point-tier to be burnt. This pretended sorcerer had been accused
and convicted of having point-tied a nobleman <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>of high
family, his wife, and all the men and women servants in his
establishment.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that no counter-charms or amulets
existed. The Curate Thiers, who has written at large upon this
subject, enumerates twenty-two different ones, the most potent of
which were the following:</p>

<p>1. To put salt in the pocket before proceeding to church;
pennies marked with the cross and put into the shoes of the bride
and bridegroom were equally efficacious.</p>

<p>2. To pass three times under the crucifix without bowing to
it.</p>

<p>3. For the bridegroom to wear upon the wedding day, two shirts,
one turned inside out upon the other, and to hold, in the left
hand, during the nuptial benediction, a small wooden cross.</p>

<p>4. To lay the new married couple naked upon the ground; to cause
the bridegroom to kiss the great toe of the bride's left foot, and
the bride the great toe of the bridegroom's right foot: after which
they must make the sign of the cross with the left hand and repeat
the same with the right or left hand.</p>

<p>5. To take the bridegroom's point-hose and pass it through the
wedding ring: knot the said point, holding the fingers in the ring,
and afterwards cut the knot saying, "God loosens what the Devil
fastens."</p>

<p>6. When the new-married couple are about to retire for the night
to fasten upon the thigh of each a little slip of paper, inscribed
with these words, <i>Domine, quis similis tibi?</i></p>

<p>7. To broach a cask of white wine from which none has yet been
drawn, and pour the first of the liquor which flows, through the
wedding ring.</p>

<p>8. To rub with wolf's grease the door posts through which the
married couple pass on their way to the nuptial bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id=
"Page_42">42</a></span>9. To write upon virgin parchment before
sunrise, and for nine days successively, the word
<i>Arigazartor</i>.</p>

<p>10. To pronounce the word <i>Temon</i> three times successively
at sunrise, provided the day promises to be fine.</p>

<p>But the mode of procedure in which the learned curate Thiers
appears to place the greatest confidence is that employed by a
priest of his acquaintance. This person's plan was to tie the bride
and bridegroom to a pillar and administer to them with his own hand
the stimulus with which the pedagogue awakens the genius of idle
and sluggish pupils; after this flagellation they are unbound and
left together, amply provided with such restorative and stimulants
as are proper to maintain the condition so favourable to Venus, in
which he had placed them. The result was in the highest degree
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Bodin informs us that he knew at Bordeaux, a woman of middle
age, but still lively and fresh, who professed to cure radically
all enchantments of this description. Nothing could be more natural
than her <i>modus operandi</i>. She got into bed with her patients,
and there by the resources of her amatory powers succeeded so well
in arousing their flagged and sluggish desires that their domestic
peace was never afterwards disturbed by the reproaches of their
disappointed spouses. Upon her mother's death, the daughter
embraced the same interesting profession and in addition to
acquiring considerable reputation by her successful practise,
realized a handsome fortune.</p>

<p>Ridiculous and contemptible as this quackery now appears, so
great at one time was its power, that persons every way qualified
for the generative act, have been seen suddenly reduced to a
humiliating nullity, in consequence of an impudent charlatan, a
village sorcerer or a fortune-teller having threatened them with
point-tying. Saint Andr&eacute;, a French physician, gives an
account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id=
"Page_43">43</a></span> of a poor weaver, who having disappointed
Madame Andr&eacute; in not bringing home some work was threatened
by that lady with being point-tied by her husband the doctor. The
poor fellow was so alarmed that the charm had the same effect as a
reality, nor was it until the work he had in hand was finished, and
the lady had consented to restore him to his natural state, that he
could resume the exercises of his conjugal duties.</p>

<p>Venette gives the case of one Pierre Buriel. "This man," to use
Venette's own words, "was about thirty-five years of age, a cooper
and brandy manufacturer by trade. Being at work one day for my
father in one of his country houses, he offended me by some
impertinent observations, to punish which I told him the next day
that I would point-tie him when he married. It so happened that he
had the intention of uniting himself with a servant girl who lived
in the neighbourhood, and although I had threatened him merely in a
jesting manner, it made so strong an impression upon him that
although, when married, he felt the most ardent desire to enjoy his
connubial rights, he found himself totally incapacitated for the
work of love. Sometimes when he flattered himself with being on the
point of accomplishing his wishes, the idea of the witchcraft
obtruded itself, and rendered him for the time completely impotent.
This incapacity alienated the affections of his wife, and produced
on her part towards him the most repulsive coldness. I need not say
what gain I felt on witnessing these effects, how I regretted
having, I may truly say, unintentionally caused so unpleasant a
state of things, and I did and said everything in my power to
disabuse the man, and prove to him the folly of his impressions.
But the more I did so, the more he testified his abhorrence of me,
and his conviction that I had really bewitched him. At length the
curate of Notre Dame, who had married them, interfered, and after
some time succeeded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id=
"Page_44">44</a></span> though with considerable difficulty, in
freeing him from his imaginary bonds. They lived together for
twenty-eight years, and several children, now citizens of Rochelle,
were the issue of their union."</p>

<p>Montaigne gives us a curious story upon this subject, which he
introduces thus: "I am not satisfied and make a very great
question, whether those pleasant ligatures with which the age of
ours is so fettered&mdash;and there is almost no other
talk&mdash;are not mere voluntary impressions of apprehension and
fear; for I know by experience, in the case of a particular friend
of mine, one for whom I can be as responsible as for myself, and a
man that cannot possibly fall under any manner of suspicion of
sufficiency, and as little of being enchanted, who having heard a
companion of his make a relation of an unusual frigidity that
surprised him at a very unseasonable time, being afterwards himself
engaged upon the same account, the horror of the former story so
strangely possessed his imagination that he ran the same fortune
the other had done; he from that time forward (the scurvy
remembrance of his disaster running in his mind and tyrannizing
over him) was extremely subject to relapse into the same
misfortune. He found some remedy, however, for this inconvenience
by himself frankly confessing and declaring beforehand to the party
with whom he was to have to do, the subjection he lay under, and
the infirmity he was subject to; by which means the contention of
his soul was, in some sort, appeased; and knowing that now some
such misbehaviour was expected from him, the restraint upon those
faculties grew less, and he less suffered by it, and afterwards, at
such times as he could be in no such apprehension as not being
about any such act (his thoughts being then disengaged and free,
and his body being in its true and natural state) by causing those
parts to be handled and communicated to<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span> the knowledge of others,
he was at last totally freed from that vexatious infirmity. After
man has once done a woman right, he is never after in danger of
misbehaving himself with that person, unless upon the account of a
manifest and inexcusable weakness. Neither is this disaster to be
feared but in adventures where the soul is over-extended with
desire or respect, and especially where we meet with an unexpected
opportunity that requires a sudden and quick despatch; and in these
cases, there is no possible means for a man always to defend
himself from such a surprise as shall put him damnably out of
countenance. And yet I have known some who have secured themselves
for this misfortune by coming half-sated elsewhere, purposely to
abate the ardour of their fury, and others who being grown old,
find themselves less impotent by being less able; and particularly
one who found an advantage by being assured by a friend of his that
had a countercharm against certain enchantments that would defend
him from this disgrace. The story itself is not much amiss, and
therefore you shall have it.&mdash;A count of a very great family,
and with whom I had the honour to be familiarly intimate, being
married to a very fair lady, who had formerly been pretended to and
importunately courted by one who was invited to and present at the
wedding. All his friends were in very great fear, but especially an
old lady, his kinswoman, who had the ordering of the solemnity, and
in whose house it was kept, suspecting his rival would, in revenge,
offer foul play, and procure some of these kinds of sorceries to
put a trick upon him, which fear she also communicated to me, who,
to comfort her, bade her not trouble herself, but rely upon my care
to prevent or frustrate any such designs. Now, I had, by chance,
about me, a certain flat piece of gold, whereon were graven some
celestial figures good to prevent frenzy occasioned by the heat of
the sun, or for any pains of the head, being applied to the suture;
where, that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id=
"Page_46">46</a></span> might the better remain firm, it was sewed
to a ribbon, to be tied under the chin. A foppery cousin-german to
this of which I am speaking was Jacques Pelletier who lived in the
house, presented to me for a singular rarity and a thing of
sovereign virtue. I had a fancy to make some use of this quack, and
therefore privately told the count that he might probably run the
same fortune other bridegrooms had sometimes done, especially some
persons being in the house who, no doubt, would be glad to do him
such a courtesy; but let him boldly go to rest, for I would do him
the office of a friend, and if need were, would not spare a miracle
that it was in my power to do, provided he could engage to me, upon
his honour, to keep it to himself, and only when they came to bring
him his candle (a custom in France being to bring the bridegroom a
candle in the middle of the night, on his wedding night) if matters
had not gone well with him, to give such a sign, and leave the rest
to me. Now, he had his ears so battered and his mind so
prepossessed with the eternal tattle of this business, that when he
came to it, he did really find himself tired with the trouble of
his imagination, and accordingly, at the time appointed, gave me
the sign. Whereupon I whispered him in the ear, that he should rise
under pretence of putting us out of the room, and after a jesting
manner, pull my night-gown from my shoulders, throw it over his
own, and keep it there till he had performed what I appointed him
to do, which was that when we were all gone out of the chamber, he
should withdraw to make water, should three times repeat such and
such words and as often do such and such actions; that at every of
the three times be should tie the ribbon I put into his hand about
his middle, and be sure to place the medal that was fastened to it
(the figures in such a posture) exactly upon his reins; which being
done, and having the last of the three times so well girt and
fastened the ribbon that it could neither untie nor slip<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> from
its place, let him confidently return to his business, and withal
not to forget to spread my gown upon the bed so that it might be
sure to cover them both. These ridiculous circumstances are the
main of the effect, our fancy being so far seduced as to believe
that so strange and uncouth formalities must of necessity proceed
from some abstruse science. Their inanity gives them reverence and
weight. However, certain it is that my figures proved themselves
more <i>Veneran</i> than <i>Solar</i>, and the fair bride had no
reason to complain."</p>

<p>Upon a due consideration of this singular superstition, it must
be obvious to any person of sense that these pretended ligatures
are, in fact, the consequence of an enfeebled constitution, weak
intellects, and sometimes of an ardent imagination, an over-excited
desire which carries the vitality to the head, and diverts it from
its principal direction. Do away with these circumstances and
imagine a man in full health, and gifted with a young and vigorous
constitution, alike incapable of allowing himself to be acted upon
by vain terrors, and of permitting his passions an uncontrolable
course; and all the charms and incantation of these redoubted
point-tiers would immediately cease. Who, for instance, could
pretend to point-tie that hero of ancient Greece so famous for his
twelve labours, of which by far the most brilliant was the
transforming, in the course of one night, fifty young virgins into
as many women!<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>The most singular circumstance, however, connected with
impotency is, that for a long time there existed exclusively in
France a particular kind of proof called&mdash;The Judicial
Congress. In the old jurisprudence of that country but little value
was attached to moral proofs; all was made to depend upon material
ones, which were made by witnesses. The whole enquiry after truth
was made to depend upon the establishment of the fact, and, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>too
frequently, the administrators of the law were not over-scrupulous
as to the nature of the testimony by which it was to be proved.
Provided there were such testimony, no matter of whatever kind, no
matter how contradictory to common sense, justice pronounced itself
satisfied, for, relying upon this testimony it was enabled to
pronounce its decision, and this was all it required. Hence all
those personal examinations of litigants, so often practised
formerly, and hence the judge, whatever might be the nature of the
suit or complaint, ordered a report to be made by parties chosen to
that effect, and who were called <i>experts</i> or examiners. This
mode of procedure was employed in cases in which a woman applied
for a divorce from her husband on the ground of impotency: hence
arose the <i>Congr&eacute;s</i>, in which the justice of the
application was to be proved in the presence of examiners appointed
to give in a report upon the case to the court. "Ce qui est encore
plus honteux," says a writer of the 17th century, "c'est qu'un
quelques proc&eacute;s, les hommes ont visit&eacute; la femme, et
au contraire, les femmes ont &eacute;t&eacute; admises &agrave;
visiter l'homme, qui a &eacute;t&eacute; cause d'une grande irrison
et moquerie, que telles proc&eacute;dures ont servi de contes
joyeux et plaisans discours en beaucoup d'endroits."<a name=
"FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class=
"fnanchor">68</a> The whole was a most disgusting procedure, which,
although greatly abused, was for a long time encouraged as offering
a legal mode of dissolving a marriage which was incompatible with
the happiness of both the parties, but which the law declared to be
indissoluble. The judges who introduced or maintained the Congress,
who, in fact, protected it, only contemplated it, but certainly
most erroneously as a proper means of legalizing divorces.</p>

<p>All historians, and other writers who have treated of this
disgraceful institution, pretty generally agree in giving it an
origin <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id=
"Page_49">49</a></span>not further back than the commencement of
the 16th century; it is, however, but the extension of a custom
almost as obscene which prevailed in the first ages of
Christianity. This was nothing less than the subjecting a young
girl, whether nun or otherwise, accused of fornication, to a
rigorous personal examination, whence was to result the proof of
her innocence or guilt. Siagrius, Bishop of Verona, and who lived
towards the close of the fourth century, condemned a nun to undergo
this disgusting and insulting examination. St. Ambroise, his
metropolitan, disapproved of the Bishop's sentence, declared the
examination as indecent, thus attesting its existence. The opinion,
however of this prelate, supposed as it was by that of several
others, did not prevent the continuance of this custom for a very
long time. The ecclesiastical and civil tribunals frequently
directed this proof to be made; and Venette<a name="FNanchor_69"
id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
cites the proc&egrave;s-verbal of a similar examination made by
order of the Mayor of Paris in 1672, in the case of a woman who
complained of violence committed on her by a man of dissolute
habits.</p>

<p>We prefer giving the following curious description of the manner
of conducting the Congress in the original quaint and antiquated
French:</p>

<p>The first judicial sentence which ordered a Congress is said to
have been caused by the shameless effrontery of a young man who,
being accused of impotency, demanded permission to exhibit proof of
his powers before witnesses, which demand being complied with, the
practice was introduced into the jurisprudence of the country. But,
as we have already shown, the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span> custom of the Judicial
Congress may be referred to a far earlier period, in fact, to the
remotest times of the middle ages, and that it originated with the
Church, when the public morals were far from being well
ascertained, as is proved by many well-known privileges belonging
to the Seigneur or Lord of the Manor. Pope Gregory the Great, who
was raised to the Pontificate in 590, appears to have been the
first who conferred upon bishops the right of deciding this
description of questions. It was, doubtless, from considerations of
tender regard for female modesty that the Church took upon itself
the painful duty of investigating and deciding upon questions of
this nature. Numerous instances prove this, especially the
dissolution of the marriage of Alphonso VI. of Portugal and his
Consort, pronounced in 1688, and mentioned by Bayle.<a name=
"FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class=
"fnanchor">70</a> The great antiquity of this custom is proved by
the 17th Art. of the Capitulars of Pepin, in the year 752, which
bears a direct allusion to it: inasmuch as that article established
as a principle that the impotency of a husband should be considered
as a lawful cause for divorce, and that the proof of such impotency
should be given, and the fact verified at the foot of the
Cross&mdash;<i>exeant ad crucem, et si verum fuerit,
separantur</i>.</p>

<p>That the Congress originated with the Church, who considered it
as an efficacious means for deciding questions of impotency, is
still further proved by the President Boutrier and by other
writers, who assert that the ecclesiastical judges of other times
were alone empowered (to the exclusion of all secular ones) to take
cognizance of cases of impotency.</p>

<p>It is well attested that during the 16th and 17th centuries all
the courts of law in France held the opinion that a marriage be
anulled on the demand of a wife who claimed the Congress.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id=
"Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>The fatal blow to this disgusting custom was given by a decree
of the Parliament of Paris, under the presidency of the celebrated
Lamoignon, dated Feb. 18, 1677, which decree forbids the practice
by any other court whatsoever, ecclesiastical or civil. It is
supposed that the ridicule cast upon it by the following lines of
Boileau had no small share in causing its suppression.</p>

<p>Three causes were alleged for the abolition of the
Congress&mdash;its obscenity, its inutility, and its
inconveniences. Its obscenity; for what could be more infamous,
more contrary to public decency and to the reverence due to an oath
than the impurity of the proof, both in its preparation and
execution? Its inutility; for what could be less certain and more
defective? Can it be, for one moment, imagined that a conjunction
ordered by judges between two persons embittered by a law-suit,
agitated with hate and fury against each other, can operate in
them? Experience has shown that, of ten men the most vigorous and
powerful, hardly one was found that came out of this shameful
combat with success; it is equally certain that he who had unjustly
suffered dissolution of his marriage, for not having given a proof
of his capacity in the infamous Congress, had given real and
authentic evidences of it in a subsequent marriage. This degrading
mode of proof, in short, far from discovering the truth, was but
the cause and foundation for impotence and falsehood. Its
inconveniences; these are&mdash;the declared nullity of a
legitimate marriage&mdash;the dishonour cast upon the husband, and
the unjust damages, oftentimes exorbi<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>tant, which he is condemned to
pay&mdash;two marriages contracted upon the dissolution of the
first&mdash;both of which, according to purity and strictness, are
equally unlawful&mdash;the error or the malice discovered, <i>ex
post facto</i>, and, nevertheless, by the authority of the law,
became irreparable.</p>

<p>It was in the power of the magistrate, upon a complaint of
impotency being alleged by a wife against her husband, to order
examiners to make an inspection of the husband's parts of
generation, and upon their report to decide whether there was just
cause for a divorce; and this without proceeding to order the
congress. The following are a few cases of this description, and
are extracted from the reports and judgments of the Officialty at
Paris in cases of impotency.</p>

<p>Case I. Jean de But, master fringe maker, was, in 1675, charged
with impotency by Genevieve Helena Marcault, his wife; he being
inspected by Renauolot, a physician, and Le Bel, a surgeon, by
order of the official; they declared that, after a due and thorough
examination of all the members and parts of the said De But, as
well genital, as others which might throw a light upon the case and
likewise his condition of body, his age, the just conformation and
proportion of his limbs, but especially his penis, which was found
to be of as proper a thickness, length and colour as could be
wished: and likewise his testicles, which exhibited no perceptible
viciousness or malformation, they are of opinion that from all
these outward marks, which are the only ones they consider
themselves justified in judging from, the said De But is
capacitated to perform the matrimonial act. Signed by them at
Paris, July 18, 1675, and attested by the Sieur de Combes. And on
August 23, 1675, by the sentence of M. Benjamin, official, the said
Marcault was non-suited and ordered to return to her husband and
cohabit with him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id=
"Page_55">55</a></span>Case II. Inspection having been ordered by
the official of Paris of the body of Joseph Le Page, who is taxed
with impotency by Nicola de Loris, his wife, the said inspection
was made by Deuxivoi and De Farci, physicians, and Paris and Du
Fertre, surgeons; their report is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have found the exterior of his person to be like that of
other men's, the penis of a good conformation and naturally
situated, with the nut or glans bare, its adjoining parts fringed
with soft, fine hair, the scrotum of an unexceptional thickness and
extent, and in it vessels of good conformation and size, but
terminating unequally; on the right side, they end in a small,
flabby substance instead of a true testicle; and on the left side
we observed a testicle fixed to the extremity of one of the
vessels, as usual, invested in its tunicle, which left testicle we
do not find to be at all flabby, but of a middling size: upon the
whole, we are of opinion that the said Le Page is capable of the
conjugal act but in a feeble manner. Signed and dated March 5,
1684. By the sentence of M. Cheron, the official, the said De
Loris's petition is rejected, and she is enjoined to return to her
husband.</p>

<p>Case III. Peter Damour being accused of impotency by his wife
Louisa Tillot an inspection was ordered to be made by Rainset and
Afforti, physicians, and Franchet and Colignon, surgeons. They
report as follows:&mdash;"We have proceeded to inspect Peter
Damour, master saddler at Paris, and having attententively examined
his parts of generation, we have found them well constituted and in
good condition as to their size, conformation and situation for the
conjugal act; according, however to the statement of the said
Damour himself, the erection is imperfect, the penis not being
sufficiently rigid for perforating the vagina; admitting this,
however, to be the case, we are of opinion that the imperfection
may be remedied, repaired, and<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span> rectified, in time, by proper
remedies. Signed January 16, 1703. In consequence the official, M.
Vivant, refused Villot's demand, and ordered her to go home to her
husband and cohabit with him as her lawful spouse.</p>

<p>Case IV. In the suit of Demoiselle Maris Louise Buch&egrave;res
accusing of impotence Antoine de Bret, an inspection was ordered
and performed by Venage and Lita, physicians, Lombard and Delon,
surgeons. They reported as follows: "We find the string of the
foreskin shorter than it should be for giving the nut free scope to
extend itself when turgid:&mdash;that the body of the left testicle
is very diminutive and decayed, its tunicle separated, the
spermatic vessels very much disordered by crooked swollen
veins&mdash;that the right testicle is not of a due thickness,
though thicker than the other: that it is somewhat withered and the
spermatic vessels disordered by crooked swollen veins. On all which
accounts we do not think that the natural parts of the said Sieur
de Bret have all the disposition requisite for the well performing
the functions they were designed for; yet we cannot say that he is
impotent until we have inspected the wife. Paris July 11, 1703,
Signed. On the 22d of July, 1703, the wife was inspected by the
said physicians and surgeons and by two matrons; the result of
which was that they observed no visciousness of conformation in her
womb: the valvula were circular and the caruncl&aelig; myrtiformes,
placed in the neck of the vagina, were soft, supple, flexible,
entire, and did not seem to have suffered any violence or
displacing, and the cavity of the womb-pipe was free and without
any obstacle. Therefore they are of opinion that she is not capable
of the conjugal act, and that there has been no intromission,
consequently that she is a virgin, and that if the marriage had not
been consummated, it is her husband's fault, because of his great
debility and defective conformation of his parts of generation.
Another inspection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id=
"Page_57">57</a></span> of the same parties was ordered Aug. 1,
1703. Bourges and Thuillier being the physicians, and Tranchet and
Meri the surgeons, who declared that after due and careful
examination they had found no defect which could hinder generation.
Their report is dated Paris, Aug. 13, 1703. M. Chapelier ordered,
in consequence, both parties,&mdash;viz., the Sieur De Bret and the
said Buch&egrave;res to acknowledge each other for man and
wife.</p>

<p>Case V. On the 2nd April, 1653, the Chevalier Ren&eacute; de
Cordovan, Marquis de Langey, aged 25 years, married Maria de Saint
Simon de Courtomer between 13 and 14 years of age. The parties
lived very happily for the first four years, that is to say, up to
1657, when the lady accused her husband of impotency. The complaint
was heard before the <i>Lieutenant Civil</i> of the
<i>Chatelet</i>, who appointed a jury to examine the parties. The
examination was made, and the report declared that both parties
were duly and fully qualified for performing the conjugal act. In
order to invalidate this report the lady affirmed that if she was
not a virgin it was in consequence of the brutal efforts of one
whose impotency rendered him callous as to the means he employed to
satisfy himself. The Chevalier de Langey, much incensed at this
imputation, demanded the <i>Congress</i>; the judge granted the
petition, the wife appealed from the sentence, but it was confirmed
by the superior courts.</p>

<p>For carrying the sentence into effect, the house of a person
named Turpin, who kept baths, was chosen. Four physicians, five
surgeons and five matrons were present. It is impossible to enter
into the details of this disgusting prequisition; they are given in
full detail in the <i>proc&egrave;s verbal</i>. Suffice it to say
that the event being unfavourable to the chevalier, his marriage
was declared void by a decree of the 8th of February, 1659.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id=
"Page_58">58</a></span>By this decree the chevalier was not only
condemned to pay back the dowry which he had had with his wife, but
was prohibited from contracting another marriage&mdash;the lady, on
the contrary, was allowed to enter into any other engagement she
might think fit, as being considered entirely freed from her former
bonds.</p>

<p>The next day after this decree the chevalier made his protest
against it before two notaries, declaring that he did not
acknowledge himself to be impotent, and that he would, in defiance
of the prohibition imposed upon him, enter into wedlock again
whenever he pleased.</p>

<p>The lady St. Simon contracted a marriage with Peter de Caumont,
Marquis de Bo&egrave;sle, and from this marriage were born three
daughters. At the same time the Chevalier de Langley married Diana
de Montault de Navaille, and their marriage was followed by the
birth of seven children.</p>

<p>In 1670 the Marchioness de Bo&egrave;sle, the ci-devant Countess
de Langey, died.</p>

<p>It was in consequence of the ulterior proceedings in the law
courts respecting the real paternity of the children of the
marchioness that the government availed itself of the opportunity
of abolishing, as we have seen, the useless and obscene ordeal of
the congress.</p>

<p>We shall conclude the present Essay by transcribing Dr.
Willick's judicious observations upon the sexual intercourse.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Of the</i> <span class="smcap">Sexual
Intercourse</span> <i>in particular; its physical consequences with
respect to the Constitution of the Individual; under what
circumstances it may be either conducive or detrimental to
Health.</i></p>

<p>"A subject of such extensive importance, both to our
physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id=
"Page_59">59</a></span> and moral welfare, as the consequences
resulting from either a too limited or extravagant intercourse
between the sexes deserves the strictest enquiry, and the most
serious attention of the philosopher.</p>

<p>The inclination to this intercourse, and the evacuation
connected with it, are no less inherent in human nature than other
bodily functions. Yet, as the semen is the most subtle and
spirituous part of the human frame, and as it contributes to the
support of the nerves, this evacuation is by no means absolutely
necessary; and it is besides attended with circumstances not common
to any other. The emission of semen enfeebles the body more than
the loss of twenty times the same quantity of blood; more than
violent cathartics, emetics, &amp;c.; hence excesses of this nature
produce a debilitating effect on the whole nervous system, on both
body and mind.</p>

<p>It is founded on the observations of the ablest physiologists,
that the greatest part of this refined fluid is re-absorbed and
mixed with the blood, of which it constitutes the most rarified and
volatile part; and that it imparts to the body singular
sprightliness, vivacity, and vigour. These beneficial effects
cannot be expected if the semen be wantonly and improvidently
wasted. Besides the emission of it is accompanied with a peculiar
species of tension and convulsion of the whole frame, which is
always succeeded by relaxation. For the same reason, even
libidinous thoughts, without any loss of semen, are debilitating,
though in a less degree, by occasioning a propulsion of blood to
the genitals.</p>

<p>If this evacuation, however, took place only in a state of
superfluity, and within proper bounds, it is not detrimental to
health. Nature, indeed, spontaneously effects it in the most
healthy individuals during sleep; and as long as we observe no
difference <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id=
"Page_60">60</a></span> in bodily and mental energy after such
losses, there is no danger to be apprehended from them. It is well
established and attested by the experience of eminent physicians,
that certain indispositions, especially those of hypochondriasis
and complete melancholy and incurable by any other means, have been
happily removed in persons of both sexes, by exchanging a single
state for wedlock.</p>

<p>There are a variety of circumstances by which the physical
propriety of the sexual intercourse is in general to be determined.
It is conductive to the well being of the individual, if the laws
of nature and society (not an extravagant or disordered
imagination) induce man to satisfy this inclination, especially
under the following conditions:</p>

<p class="indent">1. In young persons, that is, adults, or those of
a middle age; as from the flexibility of their vessels, the
strength of their muscles, and the abundance of their vital
spirits, they can more easily sustain the loss thence
occasioned.</p>

<p class="indent">2. In robust persons, who lose no more than is
speedily replaced.</p>

<p class="indent">3. In sprightly individuals, and such as are
particularly addicted to pleasure; for the stronger the natural and
legal desire, the less hurtful is its gratification.</p>

<p class="indent">4. In married persons who are accustomed to it;
for nature pursues a different path, according as she is habituated
to the reabsorption or the evacuation of this fluid.</p>

<p class="indent">5. With a beloved object; as the power animating
the nerves and muscular fibres is in proportion to the pleasure
received.</p>

<p class="indent">6. After a sound sleep, because then the body is
more energetic; it is provided with a new stock of vital spirit,
and the fluids are duly prepared;&mdash;hence the early morning
appears to be<span class='pagenum2'><a name="Page_61" id=
"Page_61">61</a></span> designed by nature for the exercise of this
function; as the body is then most vigorous, and being unemployed
in any other pursuit, its natural propensity to this is the
greater; besides, at this time a few hours sleep will, in a
considerable degree restore the expended powers.</p>

<p class="indent">7. With an empty stomach; for the office of
digestion, so material to the attainment of bodily vigour, is then
uninterrupted. Lastly.</p>

<p class="indent">8. In the vernal months; as nature at this season
in particular, incites all the lower animals to sexual intercourse,
as we are then most energetic and sprightly; and as the spring is
not only the safest, but likewise the most proper time with respect
to the consequences resulting from that intercourse. It is well
ascertained by experience that children begotten in spring are of
more solid fibres, and consequently more vigorous and robust, than
those generated in the heat of summer or cold of winter.</p>

<p>It may be collected from the following circumstances, whether or
not the gratification of the sexual intercourse has been conducive
to the well-being of the body; namely, if it be not succeeded by a
peculiar lassitude; if the body do not feel heavy, and the mind
averse to reflection, these are favourable symptoms, indicating
that the various powers have sustained no essential loss, and that
superfluous matter only has been evacuated.</p>

<p>Farther, the healthy appearance of the urine in this case, as
well as cheerfulness and vivacity of mind, also prove a proper
action of the fluids, and sufficiently evince an unimpaired state
of the animal functions, a due perspiration, and a free circulation
of the blood.</p>

<p>There are times, however, in which the gratification is the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span> more
pernicious to health, when it has been immoderate, and without the
impulse of nature, but particularly in the following
situations.</p>

<p class="indent">1. In all debilitated persons; as they do not
possess sufficient vital spirits, and their strength after this
venerating emission is consequently much exhausted. Their digestion
necessarily suffers, perspiration is checked, and the body becomes
languid and heavy.</p>

<p class="indent">2. In the aged; whose vital heat is diminished,
whose frame is enfeebled by the most moderate enjoyment, and whose
vigour, already reduced, suffers a still greater diminution from
every loss that is accompanied with a violent convulsion of the
whole body.</p>

<p class="indent">3. In persons not arrived at the age of maturity;
by an easy intercourse with the other sex, they become enervated
and emaciated, and inevitably shorten their lives.</p>

<p class="indent">4. In dry, choleric and thin persons; these, even
at a mature age, should seldom indulge in this passion, as their
bodies are already in want of moisture and pliability, both of
which are much diminished by the sexual intercourse, while the bile
is violently agitated, to the great injury of the whole animal
frame. Lean persons generally are of a hot temperament; and the
more heat there is in the body the greater will be the subsequent
dryness. Hence, likewise, to persons in a state of intoxication,
this intercourse is extremely pernicious; because in such a state
the increased circulation of the blood towards the head may be
attended with dangerous consequences, such as bursting of
blood-vessels, apoplexy, etc. The plethoric are particularly
exposed to these dangers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum2'><a name="Page_63" id=
"Page_63">63</a></span> 5. Immediately after meals; as the powers
requisite to the digestion of food are thus diverted, consequently
the aliment remains too long unassimilated, and becomes burdensome
to the stomach.</p>

<p class="indent">6. After violent exercise; in which case it is
still more hurtful than in the preceding, where muscular strength
was not consumed, but only required to the aid of another function.
After bodily fatigue, on the contrary, the necessary energy is in a
manner exhausted, so that every additional exertion of the body
must be peculiarly injurious.</p>

<p class="indent">7. In the best of summer it is less to be
indulged in than in spring and autumn; because the process of
concoction and assimilation is effected less vigorously in summer
than in the other seasons, and consequently the losses sustained
are not so easily recovered. For a similar reason the sexual
commerce is more debilitating, and the capacity for it sooner
extinguished in hot than in temperate climates. The same remark is
applicable to very warm temperature combined with moisture, which
is extremely apt to debilitate the solid part. Hence hatters,
dyers, bakers, brewers, and all those exposed to steam, generally
have relaxed fibres.</p>

<p>It is an unfavourable symptom if the rest after this intercourse
be uneasy, which plainly indicates that more has been lost than
could be repaired by sleep; but if, at the same time, it be
productive of relaxation, so as to affect the insensible
perspiration, it is a still stronger proof that it has been
detrimental to the constitution.<a name="FNanchor_72" id=

<h4>ESSAY III.</h4>

<h4>APHRODISIACS, OR, EROTIC STIMULI, AND<br />
THEIR OPPOSITES, AS KNOWN TO, AND USED BY,<br />
THE ANCIENTS AND MODERNS.</h4>

<p><img src="images/ill_w.png" class="floatLeft" alt="W" />When it
is considered how strongly the sexual desire is implanted in man,
and how much his self-love is interested in preserving or in
recovering the power of gratifying it, his endeavours to infuse
fresh vigour into his organs when they are temporarily exhausted by
over-indulgence, or debilitated by age cannot appear
surprising.</p>

<p>This remark particularly applied to natives of southern and
eastern climes, with whom the erotic ardour makes itself more
intensely felt; since it is there that man's imagination, as
burning as the sky beneath which he first drew breath, re-awakens
desires his organs may have long lost the power of satisfying, and
consequently it is there more especially that, notwithstanding the
continual disappointment of his hopes, he still pertinaciously
persists in searching for means whereby to stimulate his appetite
for sexual delights. Accordingly it will be found that in<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> the
remotest ages, even the vegetable, animal, and mineral kingdoms
have been ransacked for the purpose of discovering remedies capable
of strengthening the genital apparatus, and exciting it to
action.</p>

<p>But however eager men might be in the above enquiry, their
helpmates were equally desirous of finding a means whereby they
might escape the reproach of barrenness,&mdash;a reproach than
which none was more dreaded by eastern women. Such means was at
last discovered, or supposed to be so, in the mandrake,<a name=
"FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class=
"fnanchor">73</a> a plant which thenceforth became, as the
following quotation proves, of inestimable value in female
eyes.</p>

<p>"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother, Leah.
Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's
mandrakes.</p>

<p>"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast
taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes
also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night
for thy son's mandrakes.</p>

<p>"And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me, for surely I
have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that
night.</p>

<p>"And God harkened unto Leah, and she conceived and bare Jacob
the fifth son."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>There is only one other passage in the Bible in which this plant
is alluded to, and that is in Solomon's song:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id=
"Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my
beloved."<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>All that can be gathered from the former of the above quotations
is that these plants were found in the fields during the wheat
harvests and that, either for their rarity, flavour, or, more
probably, for their supposed quality of removing barrenness in
women, as well as for the stimulating powers attributed to them,
were greatly valued by the female sex. In the quotation from
Solomon's Song, the Hebrew word <i>Dudaim</i> expresses some fruit
or flowers exhaling a sweet and agreeable odour, and which were in
great request among the male sex.<a name="FNanchor_76" id=
"FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class=
"fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>According to Calmet, the word <i>Dudaim</i> may be properly
deduced from <i>Dudim</i> (pleasures of love); and the translators
of the Septuagint and the Vulgate render it by words equivalent to
the English one&mdash;mandrake. The word <i>Dudaim</i> is rendered
in our authorized version by the word <i>mandrake</i>&mdash;a
translation sanctioned by the Septuagint, which, in this place,
translates <i>Dudaim</i> by &mu;&#8134;&lambda;&alpha;
&mu;&alpha;&nu;&delta;&rho;&alpha;&gamma;&omicron;&rho;&#8182;&nu;,
<i>mandrake</i>&mdash;apples, and in Solomon's Song by
&omicron;&#7985;
&mu;&alpha;&nu;&delta;&rho;&alpha;&gamma;&#8056;&rho;&alpha;&iota;
(<i>mandrakes</i>). With this, Onkelos<a name="FNanchor_77" id=
"FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
and the Syrian version agree; and this concurrence of authorities,
with the fact that the mandrake (<i>atropa mandragora</i>) combines
in itself all the circumstances and traditions required for the
Dudaim, has given to the current interpretation, its present
prevalence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id=
"Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>Pythagoras was the first (followed by Plutarch) who gave to this
plant the name of
&#7936;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&rho;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;
(man-likeness), an appellation which became very generally used;
but why he gave it is not precisely known: Calmet, however,
suggests as a reason the partial resemblance it bears to the human
form, from the circumstance of its root being parted from the
middle, downwards.</p>

<p>The opinion respecting the peculiar property of the mandrake was
not confined to the Jews, but was also entertained by the Greeks
and Romans, the former of whom called its fruit&mdash;love-apples,
and bestowed the name of <i>Mandragorilis</i> upon Venus.
Dioscorides knew it by that of
&Mu;&alpha;&nu;&delta;&rho;&alpha;&gamma;&omicron;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf;,
and remarks that the root is supposed to be used in philters or
love-potions;<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> and another writer lauds it
as exciting the amorous propensity, remedying female sterility,
facilitating conception and prolificness, adding the singular fact
that female elephants, after eating its leaves, are seized with so
irresistible a desire for copulation, as to run eagerly, in every
direction, in quest of the male.<a name="FNanchor_79" id=
"FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class=
"fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the plant Eryngium, the elder Pliny says: "The whole
variety of the Eryngium known in our (the Latin) language as the
<i>centum capita</i> has some marvellous facts recorded of it. It
is said to bear a striking likeness to the organs of generation of
either sex; it is rarely met with, but if a root resembling the
male organ of the human species be found by a man, it will ensure
him woman's love; hence it is that Phaon, the Lesbian, was so
passionately beloved of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id=
"Page_69">69</a></span>Sappho."<a name="FNanchor_80" id=
"FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> If
it be true, as is asserted by medical writers, that the above root
contains an essential oil of peculiarly stimulating qualities, the
fact would account, not only for Sappho's passion for Phaon, but
also for the high value set upon it by the rival wives of
Jacob.</p>

<p>For the same reason as that suggested by Calmet, Columella calls
the mandrake <i>semihomo</i>:</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i05">"Quamvis <i>semihominis</i>
vesano gramine f&oelig;ta</span> <span class="i0">Mandragor&aelig;
pariat flores."<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span></div>
</div>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i05">"Let it not vex thee if thy
teeming field</span> <span class="i0">The half-man Mandrake's
madd'ning seed should yield;"</span></div>
</div>

<p>and qualifies its seed by the epithet <i>vesanus</i>, because in
his time (the first century after Christ) it was still supposed to
form one of the ingredients of philters or love-potions. The
superstitious ideas attached to the mandrake were indeed so current
throughout Europe during the middle ages, that one of the
accusations brought against the Knights Templars was that of
adoring, in Palestine, an idol to which was given the name of
Mandragora.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Even, comparatively, not
very long ago, there might be seen in many of the continental towns
quacks and mountebanks exhibiting little rudely-carved figures,
which they declared to be genuine mandrakes, assuring their gaping
auditors, at the same time, that they were produced from the urine
of a gibbeted thief, and seriously warning those who might have to
pull any out of the ground to stop their ears first, for otherwise
the piercing shrieks of these plants would infallibly strike them
with deafness. Wier thus describes the manufacture of these
interesting little gentlemen: "Impostors carve <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>upon these
plants while yet green the male and female forms, inserting millet
or barley seeds in such parts as they desire the likeness of human
hair to grow on; then, digging a hole in the ground, they place the
said plants therein, covering them with sand till such time as the
little seeds have stricken root, which, it is said, would be
perfectly effected within twenty days at furthest. After this,
disinterring the plants, these impostors, with a sharp cutting
knife, so dexterously carve, pare, and slip the little filaments of
the seeds as to make them resemble the hair which grows upon the
various parts of the human body."<a name="FNanchor_83" id=
"FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class=
"fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>"I have seen," says the Abb&eacute; Rosier, "mandrakes tolerably
well representing the male and female parts of generation, a
resemblance which they owe, almost entirely, to manual dexterity.
For the intended object, a mandrake is chosen having a strong root,
which, at the end of a few inches, bifurcates into two branches. As
the root is soft, it easily takes the desired form, which it
preserves on becoming dry."<a name="FNanchor_84" id=
"FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
The author then describes the process of producing the resemblance
of human hair, and which is similar to that given above.</p>

<p>In the year 1429, a Cordelier by name Brother Richard,
fulminated from the pulpit a vigorous sermon against the amulette
then much in vogue, and called "Mandragora." He convinced his
auditors, both male and female, of its impiety and inutility, and
caused hundreds of those pretended charms which, upon that
occasion, were voluntarily delivered up to him, to be publicly
burnt. It is no doubt, to these mandragoras that an old chronicler
alludes in the following strophe:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id=
"Page_71">71</a></span> <span class='i0'>J'ai puis vu soudre en

"FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class=
"fnanchor">85</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>In the 15th century the mandrake enjoyed in Italy so great a
reputation as an erotic stimulant, that the celebrated Macchiavelli
wrote a much admired comedy upon it, called "<i>La Mandragora</i>."
The subject of this piece, according to Voltaire, who asserts
"qu'il vaut, peut &ecirc;tre mieux que toutes les pi&egrave;ces
d'Aristophane, est un jeune homme adroit qui veut coucher avec la
femme de son voisin. Il engage, avec de l'argent, un moine, un
<i>Fa tutto</i> ou un <i>Fa molto</i>, &agrave; s&eacute;duire sa
maitresse et &agrave; faire tomber son mari dans un pi&egrave;ge
ridicule. On se moque tout le long de la pi&egrave;ce, de la
religion que toute l'Europe professe, dont Rome est le centre et
dont le si&egrave;ge papal est le trone."<a name="FNanchor_86" id=
"FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class=
"fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>Callimaco, one of the dramatis-person&aelig; of this comedy,
thus eulogizes the plant in question, "Voi avete a intendere che
non &egrave; cosa pi&ugrave; certa a ingravidare, <i>d'una pozione
fatta di Mandragola</i>. Questa &egrave; una cosi sperimentata da
me due para di volte, e se non era questa, la Reina di Francia
sarebbe sterile, ed infinite altre principesse in quello Stato."<a
name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87"
class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id=
"Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"You must know that nothing is so sure to make women conceive,
as a draught composed of Mandragola. That is a fact which I have
verified upon four occasions, and had it not been for the virtues
of this plant, the queen of France, as well as many noble ladies of
that kingdom, would have proved barren."</p>

<p>By the Venetian law the administering of love-potions was
accounted highly criminal. Thus the law "<i>Dei maleficii et
herbarie</i>." Cap. XVI. of the code, entitled "Della Commissione
del maleficio" says, Statuimo etiamdio che se alcun homo o femina
harra fatto maleficii, iguali so dimandono volgarmente
<i>amatorie</i>, o veramente alcuni altri maleficii, che alcun homo
o femina se havesson in odio, sia frusta et bollade, et che hara
consigliato, patisca simile pena."<a name="FNanchor_88" id=
"FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class=
"fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>The notion of the efficacy of love powders was also so prevalent
in the 15th century in our own country that in the Parliament
summoned by King Richard III., on his usurping the throne, it was
publicly urged as a charge against Lady Grey, that she had
bewitched King Edward IV. by strange potions and amorous
charms.</p>

<p>"And here also we considered how that the said pretended
marriage betwixt the abovenamed King Edward and Elizabeth Grey, was
made of great presumption, without the knowing and assent of the
Lords of this land, and also by sorcery and witchcraft committed by
the said Elizabeth and her mother Jaquet Duchesse of Bedford, as
the common opinion of the people and the public voice and fame is
thorow all this land." <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id=
"Page_73">73</a></span>(From the "Address of Parliament to the high
and mightie Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.")<a name=
"FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class=
"fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>Modern writers, as might be expected, have taken a very wide
range in their inquiries as to what kind of plant the Duda&iuml;m
really was, some regarding it as lilies, roses, violets, snowdrops,
and jasmine; others, as melons, plantain fruits, whirtleberries,
dwarf brambles, the berries of the physalis or winter cherry,
grapes of some peculiar kinds, or even underground fungi, as
truffles, &amp;c. Many have supposed the word to mean the
ingredients, whatever they might have been, of a charm or love
potion, and hence have recurred to the mandrake, celebrated, as
already said, throughout antiquity, for its supposed virtues, and
whose history has been tricked out with all the traditionary
nonsense that might be imagined to confirm that report of such

"#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> in 1660; the younger
Rudbeck,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> in 1733, and Celsius,<a
name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92"
class="fnanchor">92</a> in 1745, have displayed much erudition and
research in their inquiries; but the first of these writers arrived
at the conclusion that nothing certain could be come to on the
subject; while the second proposed raspberries as the Duda&iuml;m;
and the third maintained that they were the fruit of the Zizyphus,
the Spina Christi of the disciples of Linn&aelig;us.</p>

<p>Maundrell, who travelled in the East in the 17th century,
informs us that, having asked the chief priest of Aleppo what sort
of a plant or fruit the Duda&iuml;m, or (as we translate it) the
<i>mandrakes</i>, were which Leah gave to Rachel for the purchase
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id=
"Page_74">74</a></span>of her husband's embraces, the holy man
replied "that they were plants of a large leaf bearing a certain
sort of fruit, in shape resembling an apple, growing ripe in
harvest, but of an ill savour, and not wholesome. But the virtue of
them was to <i>help conception</i>, being laid under the genial
bed. That the women were wont to apply it at this day, out of an
opinion of its prolific virtue."<a name="FNanchor_93" id=
"FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class=
"fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Some writers have supposed the Duda&iuml;m to be neither more
nor less than the truffle. Virey asserts it to be a species of
Orch&iuml;s; and, indeed, considering the remarkable conformation
of the root of this plant,<a name="FNanchor_94" id=
"FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
the slightly spermatic odour of its farinaceous substance, as well
as that of the flowers of another one belonging to the same family,
an odour so similar to the emanations of an animal proverbial for
its salaciousness, and to which its bearded spikes or ears give
additional resemblance, the almost unbounded confidence which the
ancients reposed in its aphrodisiacal virtues cannot appear
surprising.</p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary aphrodisiacs upon record is that
reported to have been employed by the Amazons. The "Amazons," says
Eustathius,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> "broke either a leg or an
arm of the captives they took in battle, and this they did, not
only to prevent their attempts at escape, or their plotting, but
also, and this more especially, to render them more vigorous in the
venereal conflict; for, as they themselves burnt away the right
breast of their female children in order that the right arm might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id=
"Page_75">75</a></span>become stronger from receiving additional
nutriment, so they imagined that, similarly, the genital member
would be strengthened by the deprivation of one of the extremities,
whether a leg or an arm. Hence, when reproached by the Scythians
with the limping gait of her slaves, Queen Antianara replied,
"&#7940;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;
&chi;&omega;&lambda;&#8056;&sigmaf;
&omicron;&iota;&phi;&epsilon;&#8150;," "the lame best perform the
act of love."</p>

<p>Among the ancient Romans, it was impossible that philters, or
love-potions, should not be introduced amid the general depravity
so common in every class; and hence we meet with frequent allusions
to them in their writers. Thus, the emperor Julian, surnamed the
Apostate, writing to his friend Callixines, observes "At enim
inquies, Penelopes etiam amor et fides erga virum tempore cognita
est. Et quis, tandem, inquam, in muliere amorem conjugis sui
religioni ac pietati anteponet <i>quam continu&ograve;
mandragor&aelig; bibesse judicitur</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_96" id=
"FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class=
"fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>"But you, Callixines, observe that Penelope's love to her
husband was always thus manifested. To this I answer, who but he
<i>that has habitually drunk Mandragora</i> can prefer in a woman
conjugal affection to piety?"</p>

<p>The over excitement caused in the nervous system by such potions
frequently proved fatal. Such, according to Eusebius, was the fate
of the poet Lucretius, who, having been driven to madness by an
amatory potion, and having, during the intervals of his insanity,
composed several books, which were afterwards corrected by Cicero,
died by his own hand, in the 44th year of his age.<a name=
"FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class=
"fnanchor">97</a> It should, however, be remembered that this <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>account
has been questioned by the poet's translator and annotator, the
late Mr. Mason Good, in these words:</p>

<p>"By whom the potion was administered is conjectured only from a
passage in St. Jerome,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a
href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> who says that a certain
Lucilia killed her husband or her lover by giving him a philtre,
which was intended to secure his love, but the effect of which was
to make him insane. This Lucilia is supposed to have been the wife
or the mistress of Lucretius, but by whom the supposition was first
made, I am not able to discover."<a name="FNanchor_99" id=
"FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
Suetonius relates the same thing of Caius Caligula, who although,
when he arrived at manhood, endured fatigue tolerably well, was
still occasionally liable to faintness, owing to which he remained
incapable of any effort. He was not insensible to this disorder of
his mind, and sometimes had thoughts of retiring.<a name=
"FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class=

<p>"It is thought that his wife C&aelig;sonia administered to him a
love-potion, which threw him into a phrensy." It is in allusion to
this that Juvenal writes</p>

<p>These concoctions were publicly sold at Rome, their ingredients
consisting of herbs of various kinds, in the culling and testing of
which the shepherds were often employed. The remora, or
sucking-fish, certain bones of the frog, the astroit, or star-fish,
and the hippomanes were also used. Horace informs us that dried
human marrow and liver were also had recourse to:</p>

<p>Del Rio<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href=

"FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class=
"fnanchor">105</a> assert that to the above were likewise added
nail-parings, sundry metals, reptiles, and the intestines of
particular birds and fishes, and even <i>semen virile</i> and
<i>sanguis menstruus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_106" id=
"FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
During the concoction of these filthy, disgusting, and abominable
compounds, the Infernal Deities were earnestly invoked.</p>

<p>Of all the above ingredients the most famous was the hippomanes,
which, according to Wier, was a piece of flesh upon the <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id=
"Page_78">78</a></span>forehead of a young colt, of a black or
brown colour, in size and shape like a fig, which the mare is said
to bite off as soon as she has foaled, the mare forsaking her
offspring when prevented from so doing; hence the hippomanes, which
was in reality nothing more than a caul or part of the omentum
attached to the head of the foal, as it is also sometimes to that
of infants, was thought to be particularly effective in
conciliating love, especially when calcined or reduced to powder,
and swallowed in some of the blood of the person beloved. This
superstition is, however, in some degree excusable, if it be
considered that, even in the present day, many persons in our own
country firmly believe the human caul to have the power of saving
its possessor from drowning; and that in the good old times, it was
regarded as a visible indication that Providence had designed the
infant so furnished for the service of religion, such children,
whether male or female, being destined, in consequence, for the
cloister.</p>

<p>Virgil thus mentions it as one of the ingredients of the philter
that Dido caused to be made for her previously to her committing
suicide:</p>

<p>The following curious account of the wonderful effects of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id=
"Page_79">79</a></span>hippomanes, and which fully justifies the
etymology of that word, is given by Pausanias:</p>

<p>"Among these (offerings) you may behold those of Phormis
Menalius.... His gifts in Olympia are two horses and two
charioteers, one of which horses the &AElig;lians assert to have
been made by a magician, of brass, into which metal he had
previously infused the <i>hippomanes</i>, and which, in
consequence, possessed the power of exciting in horses a mad desire
for coition. The horse so made by the magician was, both in size
and shape, inferior to many horses which are dedicated within
Altis, and was rendered still more deformed by having no tail.
Horses desire connection with this image not only in spring, but
every day throughout the year, for, breaking their bridles or
running away from their drivers, they rush into Altis and attack
the horse in a manner much more furious than if it was the most
beautiful mare, and one they were acquainted with. Their hoofs,
indeed, slip from the side of the image, but nevertheless they
never cease neighing vehemently and leaping furiously on the figure
till they are driven off by the whip or by some other violent
means, for till such methods are applied, it is impossible to
disengage them from the brass."<a name="FNanchor_108" id=
"FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class=
"fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>Many formula for love-potions may be found in the work of
Albertus Magnus, who, among other things, particularly recommends
"the brains of a partridge calcined into powder and swallowed in
red wine," a remedy which is also much insisted upon by Platina,
who, in praising the flesh of the partridge, says, "Perdicis caro
bene ac facile concoquitur, multum in se nutrimenti habet, cerebri
vim auget, <i>genituram facilitat ac demortuam Venerem
excitat</i>."<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id=
"Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"The flesh of the partridge, which is of good and easy
digestion, is highly nutritious; it strengthens the brain,
facilitates conception, and arouses the half-extinct desire for
venereal pleasures." Mery<a name="FNanchor_110" id=
"FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
confidently prescribes, for the same purpose, the <i>partes
genitales</i> of a cock prepared and administered in like
manner.</p>

<p>The following compositions enjoyed a vast reputation during the
17th century:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fortuna Veneris.</span>&mdash;"Take of
pismires or ants (the biggest, having a sourish smell, are the
best) two handfuls, spirits of wine one gallon; digeste them in a
glasse vessel, close shut, for the space of a month, in which time
they will be dissolved into a liquor; then distil them in balneo
till all be dry. Then put the same quantity of ants as before; do
this three times, then aromatize the spirit with cinnamon. Note,
that upon the spirit will float an oil which must be separated.
This spirit (continues the inventor) is of excellent use to stir up
the animal spirits insomuch that John Casimire, Palsgrave of the
Rhine, and Seyfrie of Collen, general against the Turks, did always
drink thereof when they went to fight, to increase magnanimity and
courage, which it did even to admiration."</p>

<p>"This spirit doth also <i>wonderfully irritate them that are
slothful to venery</i>."<a name="FNanchor_111" id=
"FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class=
"fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aqua Magnanimitatis.</span>&mdash;Take of
ants or pismires a handful of their eggs two hundred, of millepedes
(wood-lice) two hundred, of bees two hundred and fifty; digeste
them together, the space of a month, then pour off the clear
spirit, and keep it safe. This water or spirit is of the same value
as the former.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id=

<p>But, quitting these "fond conceits," as honest old Burton<a
name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">113</a> calls them, and investigating the subject
upon acknowledged and recognised principles, it will be found that,
as the ancient philosophers and naturalists regarded the semen as
the purest and most perfect part of our blood, the flower of our
blood and a portion of the brain, so the sole object of all
aphrodisiacal preparations should be to promote its copious
secretion.</p>

<p>Before, however, proceeding to indicate the means most conducive
thereto, it may prove interesting to the reader to be informed what
were the opinions of some of the most celebrated philosophers of
antiquity, upon the semen. "Let us first," says Montaigne,<a name=
"FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class=
"fnanchor">114</a> know whether, at least, all they (physicians)
agree about the matter whereof men produce one another....
Archesilaus, the physician, whose favourite and disciple Socrates
was, said that men and beasts were formed of a lacteous slime,
expressed by the heat of the earth. Pythagoras says that our seed
is the foam or cream of our better blood. Plato, that it is the
distillation of the marrow of the back-bones; and raises his
argument from this: that that part is first sensible of being weary
of the work. Alcmeon, that it is a part of the substance of the
brain, and that it is so, says he, is proved by its causing
weakness of the eyes in those who are over-immoderately addicted to
that exercise. Democritus, that it is a substance extracted from
soul and body. Aristotle, an excrement drawn from the aliment of
the last blood which is diffused over all our members; others, that
it is a blood concocted and digested by the heat of the
genitals."</p>

<p>But, to return from this digression. Under whatever point of
view the <i>semen verile</i> be considered, whether as containing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id=
"Page_82">82</a></span>according to some physicians, all the parts
of the f&oelig;tus, under the name of organic molecules, or as
being, in the opinion of others, merely destined to fecundate the
female egg, it will be equally true that the semen is a fluid
impregnated with a vivifying principle regarded as the most
important (<i>validissimum</i>) of our humours, by Hippocrates,
who, in support of this his opinion, adduces the fact of our
becoming debilitated, however small the quantity we may lose of it
in the venereal act.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a
href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>Zeno, the father of the Stoic philosophy, called the loss of
semen the loss of part of the animating principle; and that sage's
practice was conformable with his principles, for he is recorded to
have embraced his wife but once in his life, and that out of mere
courtesy.</p>

<p>Epicuras and Democritus were nearly of the same opinion as Zeno;
and the Athlet&aelig;, that their strength might be unimpaired,
never married. The Rabbis, in their anxiety to preserve their
nation, are said to have ordered, with a view of preventing a loss
of vigour, that a peasant should indulge but once a week, and a
merchant but once a month, a sailor but twice a year, and a
studious man but once in two years; and for the same reason, Moses
forbade indulgence before battle.</p>

<p>"Les &ecirc;tres," says a writer in the Dictionnaire des
Sciences M&eacute;dicales,<a name="FNanchor_116" id=
"FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
"qui font le plus abus de leurs facult&eacute;s intellectuelles et
sensitives ext&eacute;rieures, sont les moins capables d'un
co&iuml;t fr&eacute;quent, tandis que les idiots, les
cr&eacute;tins, l'exercent bien davantage. De m&ecirc;me,

<p>If now, it be asked what will best promote the secretion of the
seminal fluid, or, in other words, which is the best aphrodisiac,
it may be confidently answered, the use of a substantial
nourishment, such as medical men designate as an analeptic diet.
Food of this description, without fatiguing the gastric organs,
furnishes an abundant chyle, from which is elaborated a rich blood,
and in which the secretory organs find materials of an excellent
quality, and in an almost constant proportion with the regular
consumption of their products. All food of easy and quick digestion
is an analeptic, whence it follows that the same substance which is
an analeptic to one person, may prove indigestible and innutritious
for another. The numerous treatises upon digestion render it
unnecessary to specify here the different aliments most proper for
convalescents, suffice it to say, generally, that those meats in
which azezome is found are the most nutritious. This animal
principle is that extractive matter of animal fibre which produces
the red appearance of uncooked meat; it is also that which forms
what is called the <i>brown</i> of roasted meats, gives the flavour
to broths and soups, the peculiar smell to boiled meat, and
constitutes the much admired <i>gout</i> of game and venison. It is
not found in the flesh of young animals, which is said, with
reason, to be, on that very account, less nutritious. It is only
when they have attained the adult age that it appears in them; it
is abundant in beef, mutton, kid, hare, pigeon, partridge,
pheasant, woodcock, quail, duck, goose, and generally, in all
animals having dark coloured flesh. Mushrooms and oysters also
contain some, but in a very small proportion.</p>

<p>Food in which this principle exists appears to impress upon the
membrane of the stomach an increase of activity; the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span> digestion is
easy, and from a small mass of alimentary substance an abundant
chyle is obtained. The chyliferous vessels derive a very great
proportion of reparative materials; there is found but little
excrementitious residue, the blood is enriched and its course
accelerated, while the impulsive force of the heart and arteries is
strong and more lively. Under the influence of this regimen a
greater quantity of heat is developed and, in a given time, there
is a greater absorption of oxygen than during a vegetable one; the
respiration is performed more freely, the organs increase in size,
but it is then a genuine embonpoint; nutrition is, in reality, more
active, it is not a deceptive turgidity; the energy of the
secretions and exhalations is redoubled, cutaneous perspiration
becomes more abundant, and the glandular apparatus fulfil their
functions with greater facility. A man who adopts this food becomes
consequently very well fitted to make the sacrifices exacted by the
calls of love, to which he is then more frequently solicited.</p>

<p>The mollusca in general, and testaceous animals in particular,
have been considered as endowed with aphrodisiac properties.
Juvenal attributes this quality to oysters which, together with
mussles, have in this respect become vulgarly proverbial.</p>

<p>Wallich informs us that the ladies of his time had recourse, on
such occasions, to the brains of the mustela piscis. The Sepia
octopus was also in great repute, and Plautus, in his play of
Cisina, introduces an old man who has just been purchasing some at
the market.</p>

<p>Appuleius, the celebrated author of the <i>Metamorphoseon de
Asino aureo</i> (Metamorphoses of the Golden Ass), and who lived in
the 2nd century, under the Antonines, having married a rich widow,
was accused by her father &AElig;milian, before Claudius Maximus,
pro-Consul of Asia, of having employed sorcery and charms in order
to gain her affections (a parallel case with that of Shakespear's
Othello). The love-potions alleged to have been administered were
asserted to be chiefly composed of shell-fish, lobsters, sea
hedge-hogs, spiced oysters, and cuttle-fish, the last of which was
particularly famed for its stimulating qualities. Appuleius fulley
exonerated himself in his admirable <i>Apologia ceu oratio de
Magica</i>, so esteemed for the purity of its style as to have been
pronounced by Saint Augustine (De Civitate Dei, lib. xviii. c. 20)
as <i>copiosissima et disertissima oratio</i>. The reason adduced
by &AElig;milian for believing that Appuleius had chiefly used fish
for the purpose was, that they must necessarily have great efficacy
in exciting women to venery, inasmuch as Venus herself was born of
the sea.</p>

<p>Venette<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> supports this view when he
says:</p>

rassembl&eacute;e, sont plus ardents &agrave; l'amour que les

<p>Should this be true, the Infallible (?) Church must have
committed an astounding blunder in thinking to mortify, for six
weeks, the sinful lusts and affections of its dupes, by confining
them, for the above period, to the exclusive use of such articles
of food.</p>

<p>There are also some aliments which, although not included in the
class of analeptics, are, nevertheless, reported to possess
specific aphrodisiacal qualities; such are fish, truffles, and

<p>The following anecdote relative to this property in fish is
related by Hecquet:<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a
href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>"Sultan Saladin, wishing to ascertain the extent of the
continence of the dervishes, took two of them into his palace, and,
during a certain space of time, had them fed upon the most
succulent food. In a short time all traces of their self-inflicted
severities were effaced, and their <i>embonpoint</i> began to
re-appear.</p>

<p>"In this state he gave them two Odalisques<a name="FNanchor_120"
id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class=
"fnanchor">120</a> of surpassing beauty, but all whose
blandishments and allurements proved ineffectual, for the two holy
men came forth from the ordeal as pure as the diamond of
Bejapore.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>"The Sultan still kept them in his palace, and, to celebrate
their triumph, caused them to live upon a diet equally
<i>recherch&eacute;</i>, but consisting entirely of fish. A few
days afterwards they were again subjected to the united powers of
youth and beauty, but this time nature was too strong, and the too
happy cenobites forgot, in the arms of voluptuousness, their vows
of continence and chastity."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id=

<p>This peculiar property in fish has been attributed to the
presence of phosphorus, which is known to exist somewhat
plentifully in their substance, and has also been discovered in
their roes in a simple state of combination. Now, phosphorus is one
of the most powerful stimulants: it acts upon the generative
organism in a manner to cause the most violent priapisms; but this
principle does not act alone, and there must also be taken into
account the different seasonings and condiments which form the
basis of most culinary preparations to which fish are subjected,
and which are all taken from the class of irritants.</p>

<p>The prolific virtues of fish have, no doubt, been greatly
exaggerated, and it is certain that too much importance has been
given to the observation made (rather upon slight grounds) by
travellers as to the abundant population of ichthyophagic nations;
nor would it be difficult to adduce facts to prove to the
incredulous that the continuous use of fish excites lasciviousness
in such persons only as are constitutionally inclined thereto.</p>

<p>The following instances sufficiently establish the aphrodisiacal
qualities of phosphorus. A drake belonging to a chemist having
drunk water out of a copper vessel which had contained phosphorus,
ceased not gallanting his females till he died. An old man to whom
a few drops only of phosphoric ether had been administered,
experienced repeated and imperious venereal wants which he was
compelled to satisfy. Leroy and Battatz, two celebrated French
physicians of the last century, tried the effects of phosphorus
upon themselves, with similar results. Sensations of the same kind
are said to be experienced by persons whose occupation requires the
frequent handling of this drug. It may thus be considered as
satisfactorily proved that the above substance is essentially an
energetic stimulant of the genital organs; but, should still
further evidence be required,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span> it may be found in the fact
that the administration of it, even in small doses, has been
productive of the most horrible and fatal results, instances of
which are recorded in many medical works both foreign and English,
but more particularly in those of Brera, Magendie, and others.</p>

<p>The erotic properties of truffles and mushrooms are considered
by most writers as better established than those of fish. The
ancient Romans were well acquainted with truffles, and obtained
them from Greece and Africa, especially from the province of Libya,
the fungi found there being particularly esteemed for their
delicacy and flavour. In modern times, also, the truffle is
regarded as the <i>diamond</i> of the kitchen, being highly valued
for its capability of exciting the genesiac sense, it being a
positive aphrodisiac which disposes men to be exacting and women
complying.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>The following instance of its effects is given by Brillat
Savarin,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> to whom the circumstances
were communicated, in confidence, by the lady who was the subject
of them:</p>

<p>"Je soupai," says she, "un jour chez moi en trio avec mon mari
et un de ses amis dont le nom &eacute;tait V&mdash;&mdash;.
C'&eacute;tait un beau gar&ccedil;on et ne manquant pas d'esprit et
venait souvent chez moi, mais il ne m'avait jamais rien dit qui put
le faire regarder comme mon amant, et s'il me fesait la cour,
c'&eacute;tait d'une mani&egrave;re si envelopp&eacute;e qu'il n'y
avait qu'une sotte qui eut p&ucirc; s'en f&acirc;cher. Il
paraissait, ce jour l&agrave;, destin&eacute; &aacute; me tenir
compagnie pendant le reste de la soir&eacute;e, car mon mari avait
un <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id=
"Page_89">89</a></span>rendezvous et devait nous quitter
bient&ocirc;t. Notre souper avait pour base une petite volaill
truff&eacute;e. Les truffes &eacute;taient d&eacute;licieuses, et
quoique je les aime beaucoup, je me contins, nonobstant; je ne bus
aussi qu'un seul verre de Champagne, ayant quelque pressentiment
que la soir&eacute;e ne se passerait pas sans
&eacute;v&egrave;nement. Bient&ocirc;t mon mari partit et me laissa
seule avec V&mdash;&mdash; qu'il regardait comme tout &agrave; fait
sans cons&eacute;quence. La conversation roula d'abord sur des
sujets indiff&eacute;rents, mais elle ne tarda pas &agrave; prendre
une tournure plus s&eacute;rieuse et plus int&eacute;ressante.
V&mdash;&mdash; fut successivement flatteur, expansif, affectueux,
caressant, et voyant que je ne faisais que plaisanter de tant de
belles choses, il devint si pressant que je ne pus plus me tromper
de ses pr&eacute;tensions. Alors, je me reveillai comme d'une songe
et me d&eacute;fendis avec autant plus de franchise que mon
c&oelig;ur ne me disait rien pour lui. Il persistait avec une
action que pouvait devenir tout &agrave; fait offensante; j'eus
beaucoup de peine de la remener, et j'avone, &agrave; ma honte, que
toute esp&eacute;rance ne lui serait pas interdite. Enfin, il me
quitta, j'allai me coucher et dormis tout d'un somme. Mais le
lendemain fut le jour du jugement; j'examinai ma conduite de la
veille, et je la trouvai repr&eacute;hensible. J'aurais du arreter
V&mdash;&mdash; d&egrave;s les premi&egrave;res phrases, et ne pas
me pr&ecirc;ter &agrave; une conversation qui ne pr&eacute;sageait
rien de bon. Ma fiert&eacute; aurait d&ucirc; sonner, crier, me
f&acirc;cher, faire, enfin, tout ce que je ne fis pas. Que vous
dirai je, Monsieur, je mis tout cela sur le compte des truffes, et
je suis r&eacute;element persuad&eacute;e qu'elles m'avaient donne
une pr&eacute;disposition dangereuse, et si je n'y renonce pas (ce
qui eut &eacute;t&eacute; trop rigoureux) du moins je n'en mange
jamais sans que le plaisir qu'elles me causent ne soit
m&ecirc;l&eacute; d'un peu de d&eacute;fiance."</p>

<p>The mushroom was also equally well known as the truffle to the
ancient Romans for its aphrodisiacal qualities. Thus, Martial
says:</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>This bulb was believed by the ancients to be so decided a
stimulant, that it was always served up, together with pepper and
pine-nuts, at the wedding dinner.</p>

<p>An immoderate use of chocolate was, in the 17th century,
considered so powerful an aphrodisiac that Jean Franco Raucher
strenuously enforced the necessity of forbidding the monks to drink
it, adding that if such an interdiction had been laid upon it at an
earlier period, the scandal with which that sacred order had been
assailed would have been prevented. It is a singular fact that,
fearful of losing their character, or, what, perhaps, was dearer to
them, their chocolate, the worthy cenobites were so diligent in
suppressing Raucher's work that four copies only of it are said to
be in existence.</p>

<p>The history of the middle ages abounds with complaints of the
lubricity, gluttony, and drunkenness of the monks, vices which are
described as being their ruin, in the fallowing pithy distich:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i05">"Sunt tria nigrorum qu&aelig;
vestant res monachorum,</span> <span class="i0">Renes et venter et
pocula sumpta frequenter."<a name="FNanchor_125" id=
"FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class=
"fnanchor">125</a></span></div>
</div>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i05">"Three things to ruin monks
combine&mdash;</span> <span class="i0">Venery, gluttony, and
wine."</span></div>
</div>

<p>A monk who was a great enemy to adultery, was one day preaching
against it, and grew so warm in his argument, and took so much
pains to convince his congregation of his own abhorrence of it,
that at last he broke out in the following solemn declaration:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id=
"Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>"Yea, my brethren, I had rather, for the good of my soul, have
to do with ten maids every month, than, in ten years, to touch one
married woman!"</p>

<p>The celebrity they acquired in the field of Venus may readily be
imagined from a quatrain that was affixed in a conspicuous part of
the Church of St. Hyacinthe, and which runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i05">"Femmes qui d&eacute;sirez de
devenir enceinte</span> <span class="i0">Addressez cy vos
v&oelig;ux au grand Saint Hyacinthe,</span> <span class="i0">Et

your prayers apply,</span> <span class="i0">And what his Saintship
cannot accomplish</span> <span class="i0"><i>The monks within will
surely satisfy</i>."</span></div>
</div>

<p>It would have been well had these holy men been contented with
these, comparatively, venial indulgences. The following macaronic
epigram, however, shows that they were but too much addicted to the
<i>Amour Socratique</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i05">"Let a friar of some order

<p>But the open violation of their monastic vows, especially that
of chastity, sometimes subjected monks to very severe punishment, a
singular instance of which is recorded by Thevet,<a name=
"FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class=
"fnanchor">128</a> who, on account of the inimitable quaintness of
his language and style, must be allowed to tell his own story:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id=
"Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>"Phillippus Bourgoin, gr&#257;d prieur de l'Abbaye de Cluny,
voyant l'insolence, ribler&iuml;es et putasseries que menoient
certains religieux de l'abbaye de Cluny les fist appeller

et &agrave; la sainctet&eacute; de leur ordre, et appercevant

<p>To these poor monks may, however, be applied the sly remark of
Hume, upon a similar act of cruelty perpetuated, though for a far
more innocent cause, by Geoffry, the father of Henry II., upon the
prior and chapter of Seez in Normandy, viz., that "of the pain and
danger they might justly complain, yet, since they had vowed
chastity, he deprived them of a superfluous treasure."<a name=

<p>If the properties of ambergris be less potent than those of
phosphorus, they are certainly less fatal. According to Bos<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>well,<a
name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">130</a> three grains of the former suffice to
produce a marked acceleration of the pulse, a considerable
development of muscular strength, a greater activity in the
intellectual faculties, and a disposition to cheerfulness and
venereal desires. The same author also says that it is a medicine
which can, for a short time, restore an effete old man to
juvenility.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> The ancients reposed great
confidence in the virtues of this drug, employing it as a renovator
of the vital powers and of the organs, whose energy had been
exhausted by age or by excess; and throughout the East this perfume
still maintains a reputation for life-preserving qualities.</p>

<p>Madame Du Barry,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a
href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> the infamous mistress
of Louis XV., is reported to have availed herself of its
aphrodisiacal qualities <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id=
"Page_94">94</a></span>in order to stimulate the jaded appetites of
her royal paramour. "L'attachement du roi pour Madame Du Barry<a
name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133"
class="fnanchor">133</a> lui est venu des efforts prodigieux
qu'elle lui fit faire au moyen d'an bapt&ecirc;me (lavement)
ambr&eacute; dont elle se parfuma int&eacute;rieurement tous les
jours. On ajoute qu'elle joignit &agrave; cela un secret dont on ne
se sert pas encore en bonne soci&eacute;t&eacute;."</p>

<p>Piquant as is this anecdote, the key to it is equally so. "Les
mouches cantarides, i diabolini l'essence de girofl&eacute;e, les
bapt&ecirc;mes ambr&eacute;s, etc., sont des inventions de notre
siecle dont la d&eacute;bilit&eacute; eut &eacute;t&eacute;

<p>The old pharmacop&oelig;ia are amply furnished with formula of
which amber constitutes the base. These recipes are generally
designated by names which, to a certain extent, indicate the
particular use to which they are destined by their makers; thus,
France formerly boasted her "<i>Tablettes de
Magnanimit&eacute;</i>," or "<i>Electuaire Satyrion</i>," and
"<i>Un poudre de joie</i>." Troches, or odoriferous lozenges, to
which the ancients gave the pretty name of "<i>Avuncul&aelig;
Cypri&aelig;</i>," were, and perhaps are still, sold in Paris under
that of "<i>Seraglio Pastilles</i>." Ambergris forms the basis of
these, as it also does of the Indian pastilles called "Cachunde,"
and which were equally in repute. Zactus Lusitanus<a name=
"FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class=
"fnanchor">135</a> states that they were composed of bole Tuccinum,
musk, ambergris, aloes-wood, red and yellow sanders
(pterocarpus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id=
"Page_95">95</a></span>carpus santalinus) mastic, sweet-flag
(calamus aromaticus) galanga, cinnamon, rhubarb, Indian myrobalon,
absynth, and of some pounded precious stones, which, however,
impart no additional quality to the composition. Speaking of this
composition, the Encyclop&oelig;dia Perthensis describes it as "a
medicine highly celebrated among the Chinese and Indians; it is
composed of ambergris and several other aromatic ingredients,
perfumes, medicinal earths, and precious stones. It imparts a
sweetness to the breath, is a valuable medicine in all nervous
complaints, and is esteemed as a prolonger of life and <i>an
exciter to venery</i>.<a name="FNanchor_136" id=
"FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class=
"fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>Rivi&egrave;re<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a
href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> gives us the
following formula for a potion whose virtue is indisputable. "Take
of amber, half a drachm; musk, two scruples; aloes, one drachm and
a half; pound them all together, pour upon the mass a sufficient
quantity of spirits of wine so that the liquor may cover it to the
height of about five fingers' breadth; expose it to sand heat,
filter and distil it, close it hermetically, and administer it in
broth in the dose of three or five drops. This liquor is also
advantageous when mixed with syrup, prepared as follows:&mdash;Take
of cinnamon water, four ounces; orange and rose water, each six
ounces, and sugar candy q.s.</p>

<p>Musk taken internally is said by many physicians to be almost
equal to ambergris for its aphrodisiacal qualities. Externally
applied, this substance produces very singular phenomena. Borelli
details the case of a man "qui s'&eacute;tant frott&eacute; le
penis avec du musc avant de se livrer &agrave; l'exercise des
fonctions genitales, resta uni avec sa femme sans pouvoir s'en
s&eacute;parer. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id=
"Page_96">96</a></span> Il fallait, dans cette position lui donner
une quantit&eacute; de lavements afin de ramoller les parties qui
s'&eacute;taient extraordinairement tumifi&eacute;es."<a name=
"FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class=
"fnanchor">138</a> Diermerbreek and Schurigius gave similar
instances. The effects of musk are, therefore, almost equal to
those produced by certain plants, as recorded by Theophrastus:
"Esse herbas qu&aelig; vel ad <i>sexagesimum coitum</i> vim
pr&aelig;stant sed at demum secernitur sanguis."<a name=
"FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class=
"fnanchor">139</a> Weickard says that by means of this drug he
resuscitated the genital power in a man who had nearly completed
his eightieth year.</p>

<p>But, of all aphrodisiacs, the most certain and terrible in its
effects are cantharides, commonly known as Spanish flies. That they
exercise a powerful and energetic action upon the organization and
stimulate, to the utmost, the venereal desire, is but too true. The
effects, however, which these insects, when applied as a blister
upon the skin, are known to produce, are insignificant when
compared with their intense action upon the stomach when taken
internally; nor is it the stomach only which is affected by them:
the bladder experiences an irritation exceeding even that caused by
the severest strangury. To these succeed perforation of the
stomach, ulcers throughout the entire length of the intestinal
canal, dysentery, and, lastly, death in the midst of intolerable
agonies. Medical works abound with observations concerning the
fatal effects of cantharides when unduly administered, whether from
ignorance or for exciting the venereal appetite. The two following
cases are recorded by Pabrol in his "Observations Anatomiques":</p>

<p>"En 1752 nous fumes visiter un pauvre homme d'Organ en Provence
atteint du plus horrible satyriasis qu'on saurait voir et penser.
Le fait est tel. Il avait les quartes, pour en guerir <span class=

sept fois, sans y comprendre plus de dix fois qu'il

consultions, le pauvre homme spermatisa trois fois &agrave; notre
pr&eacute;sence, embrassa le pied du lit, et agitant contre lui
comme si c'eust &eacute;t&eacute; sa femme. Ce spectacle nous
&eacute;tonn et nous h&acirc;ta &agrave; lui faire des
rem&egrave;des pour abattre cette furieusse chaleur, mais quel
rem&egrave;de qu'on lui eust faire, se passa-t-il le pas."</p>

<p>"Un m&eacute;decin &agrave; Orange, nomm&eacute; Chauvel avait
&eacute;t&eacute; appell&eacute; en 1758 &agrave; Caderousse,
petite ville proche de sa r&eacute;sidence, pour voir un homme
atteint d'une maladie du m&ecirc;me genre. A l'entr&eacute;e de la
maison il trouve la femme du dit malade, laquelle se plaignit
&agrave; lui de la furieuse lubricit&eacute; de son mari, <i>qui
l'avait chevauch&eacute;e quarante fois pour une nuit</i>, et avait
toutes les parties gonfl&eacute;es, &eacute;tant contrainte les lui

l'inflammation. Le mal du mari &eacute;tant venu d'un breuvage

qui gardait l'h&ocirc;pital, pour gu&eacute;rir la fi&egrave;vre

qu'il fallait l'attacher comme s'il eust &eacute;t&eacute;
poss&eacute;d&eacute; du diable. Le vicaire du lieu fut
pr&eacute;sent, pour l'exhorter &agrave; la pr&eacute;sence
m&ecirc;me du Sieur Chauvel, lesquels il priait le laisser mourir
avec le plaisir, les femmes le pli&egrave;rent dans un linsseuil
mouill&eacute; en eau et en vinaigre, o&ugrave; il fut lass&eacute;
jusqu'au le lendemain qu'elles allaient le visiter, mais sa
furieuse chaleur fut bien abattue et eteinte, car elles le
trouv&egrave;rent roid mort, la bouche b&eacute;ante, montrant les
dents, et son membre gangr&eacute;ne."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id=
"Page_98">98</a></span>Par&eacute; also relates that a courtezan,
having sprinkled the meat given by her to one of her lovers, with
pounded cantharides, the wretched youth was seized with a violent
priapism and loss of blood at the anus, of which he died.</p>

<p>Ferdinand the Catholic, of Castile, owed his death to the
effects of a philter administered to him by his queen, Germaine de
Foix, in the hope of enabling him to beget an heir to the crowns of
Aragon, Navarre, and Naples. "Plusieurs dames," says Mignot,<a
name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140"
class="fnanchor">140</a> "attach&eacute;es &agrave; la Reine, lui

&agrave; Ferdinand pour ranimer ses forces. Cette princese fit
composer ce rem&eacute;de, sous ses yeux, et le pr&eacute;senta au
roi qui d&eacute;sirait, plus qu'elle, d'avoir un fils. Depuis ce
jour, la sant&eacute; de Ferdinand s'affaiblit, au point qu'il ne
la recouvra jamais."</p>

<p>The life of the celebrated Wallenstein, one of the heroes of the
"Thirty Years' war," was far a long time endangered from the

<p>Cardinal Dubois,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a
href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> the favourite and
minister of Philip Duke of Orleans, Regent of France, during the
minority of Louis <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id=
"Page_99">99</a></span>XV., gives the following amusing account of
a love potion, to the powerful effects of which he considered
himself indebted for his existence. "An old bachelor, of Brivas,
had engaged to marry a young lady of only sixteen years of age. The
night before the wedding he assembled the wise heads of his family
for the purpose of consulting upon the best means of enabling him
to perform his part creditably in the approaching amorous conflict.
Opinions were divided; some maintained that nature was adequate to
the occasion at any age, while others recommended a certain
preparation in the Pharmacopeia, which would amply supply the
defect of youth in a sexaginary husband. The old gentleman chose,
without hesitation, the surest and speediest of these two chances
of success. The prescription was sent to the shop of my worthy
father, who was an apothecary in the town, and he accordingly
immediately set to work, and made up a draught which would have
awakened desire even in Methusaleh himself. This valuable philter
was not to be sent to the party till the next day. It was late, and
my mother," continues the Cardinal, "desired her husband to retire
to rest and he, tired with his day's work, quickly undressed
himself, blew out his candle, and deposited himself, like a loving
husband, by the side of his dear spouse. Awakening in the middle of
the night, he complained of being excessively thirsty, and his
better half, roused from her slumbers, got up in the dark, and
groping about for something wherewith to quench his thirst, her
hand encountered the invigorating philter, which it truly proved to
be, for I came into the world precisely nine months after that
memorable night."<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a
href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>Although love-potions and philters, as well as the other
preparations had recourse to, for animating and arousing the <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id=
"Page_100">100</a></span>organs for reproduction frequently owe, as
we have shewn, their advantages to cantharides, and are, but too
often productive of terrible effects, yet it cannot be denied that
when administered by a skilful, cautious, and experienced
physician, they have restored the desired vigour when all other
means have failed.</p>

<p>The flesh of the Schinck (scincus), an amphibious animal of the
lizard species, and sometimes of the land lizard, or crocodile, is
said, when reduced to powder and drunk with sweet wine, to act
miraculously in exciting the venereal action; it is also prepared
for the same object in the form of the electuary known by the name
of Diasatyrion. &AElig;lius recommends that in order to cause the
erection of the virile organ, the flesh of this animal should be
taken from the vicinity of its genital apparatus.<a name=
"FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class=
"fnanchor">144</a> It is a well known fact that the Egyptian
peasants carried their lizards to Cairo, whence they were
forwarded, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Alexandria, to Venice and Marseilles.
This species of lizard, which feeds upon aromatic plants, was also
used as an aphrodisiac by the Arabs, and the well known
anti-poisonous quality of its flesh had caused it, in more ancient
times, to be employed as an ingredient in the far-famed
Mithridates, or antidote to poison. Browne informs us<a name=
"FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class=
"fnanchor">145</a> "that in Africa, no part of the Materia Medica
is so much in requisition as those which stimulate to venereal
pleasure. The <i>Lacerta scincus</i> in powder, and a thousand
other articles of the same kind, are in continual demand." The
plant Chervri (<i>sandix ceropolium</i>) is also accounted as
capable of exciting amorous propensities, so much so that Tiberius,
the Roman emperor, the most lascivious, perhaps, of men, is said to
have exacted a certain quantity of it from <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>the Germans, by way of
tribute, for the purpose of rendering himself vigorous with his
women and catamites; and Venette says that the Swedish ladies give
it to their husbands when they find them flag in their matrimonial
duties.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>But it was upon the plant called Satyrion (<i>orchis
mascula</i>) that those who required aphrodisiacal remedies rested
their most sanguine hopes. This plant, Theophrastus assures us,
possesses so wonderful a property of exciting venery that a mere
application of it to the parts of generation will enable a man to
accomplish the act of love twelve times successively. Speaking of
this plant, Venette<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a
href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> says that the herb
which the Indian King Androphyl sent to King Antiochus was that it
was so efficacious in exciting men to amorous enjoyment as to
surpass in that quality, all other plants, the Indian who was the
bearer of it assuring the king "qu'elle lui avait donn&eacute; de
la vigueur pour soixante dix embrassements," but he owned "qu'aux
derniers efforts ce qu'il rendait n'&eacute;tait plus de
semence."</p>

<p>Matthoile, however, observing that those persons who made use of
it did not appear much given to lasciviousness, concluded that we
had lost the true satyrion of the ancients; but, it is nevertheless
certain, notwithstanding so adverse an opinion, that this plant
long preserved its reputation, and was recommended by all botanists
for its aphrodisiac potency. Of all the species of this plant the
one popularly known as dog-stones is reputed to possess the
greatest virtue.</p>

<p>The Turks have also their Satyrion (<i>orchis morio</i>), which
grows upon the mountains near Constantinople, and which they <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>make
use of to repair their strength, and stimulate them to the
generative act. From this root is made the salep of which the
inhabitants of Turkey, Persia, and Syria, are extremely fond, being
looked upon as one of the greatest restoratives and provocatives to
venery in the whole vegetable world. But besides the aphrodisiacal
qualities attributed to this plant by the above people, they give
it credit for other ones, which good opinion experience has
confirmed, and therefore whenever they undertake a long voyage,
they never omit to carry it with them as a specific against all
diseases. Modern practitioners likewise commend its restorative,
mucilaginous and demulcent qualities as rendering it of
considerable utility, particularly in sea scurvy, diarrh&oelig;a,
dysentery, and stone or gravel. In addition to this property, salep
also possesses the very singular one of concealing the taste of sea
water, hence to prevent the dreadful calamity of perishing by
thirst at sea it has been proposed that the powder of this plant
should form part of the provisions of every ship's company.</p>

<p>Borax is likewise considered to possess peculiar aphrodisiacal
qualities. "Il p&eacute;n&egrave;tre," says Venette, "toutes les
parties de notre corps et ouvre tous les vaisseaux, et par la
t&eacute;nuit&eacute; de sa substance, <i>il conduit aux parties
g&eacute;nitales</i> tout ce qui est capable de nous servir de
mati&egrave;re &agrave; la semence."<a name="FNanchor_148" id=
"FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class=
"fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>The plant Rocket (<i>Brasica eruca</i>) has likewise been
especially celebrated by the ancient poets for possessing the
virtue of restoring vigour to the sexual organs, on which account
it was consecrated to and sown around, the statue of Priapus; thus
Columella says:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lobel<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href=

of the effects of this plant upon certain monks in the garden of
whose monastery it was sown, an infusion of it being daily doled
out to them under the impression that its cheering and exhilarating
qualities would rouse them from the state of inactivity and
sluggishness so common to the inmates of such establishments. But,
alas! the continual use of it produced an effect far more powerful
than had been contemplated by the worthy itinerant monk who had
recommended it, for the poor cenobites were so stimulated by its
aphrodisiacal virtues that, transgressing alike their monastic wall
and vows, they sought relief for their amorous desires in the fond
embraces of the women residing in the neighbourhood.</p>

id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class=

women who much indulge in it are thereby rendered more salacious,
and that, for this reason, Venus is said to have arisen from the
sea; whence the epigram:</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>To the last of the above-mentioned plants, Baptista Porta
ascribes the most wonderful powers, his words being: Planta
qu&aelig; non solum edentibus, sed et genitale languentibus tantum
valet, ut coire summe desiderant, quoties fere velint, possint;
alios <i>duodecies</i> profecisse, alios ad <i>sexaginta vices</i>
pervenisse, refert.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a
href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>Certain condiments are also aphrodisiacal, acting as they
undoubtedly do, as powerful stimulants. Thus Tourtelle and Peyrible
assure us that pepper is a provocative to venereal pleasures, while
Gesner and Chappel cured an atony of the virile member of three or
four years' duration, by repeated immersions of that organ in a
strong infusion of mustard seed.</p>

<p>The principal ingredient of the <i>Bang</i> so much used by the
Indians, as well as of the <i>Maslac</i> of the Turks is a species
of the hemp plant. The Indians, says Acosta,<a name="FNanchor_156"
id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class=
"fnanchor">156</a> masticate the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>seeds and leaves of several
species of that plant, in order to increase their vigour in the
venereal congress, and very frequently combine with it, ambergris,
musk, and sugar, preparing it in the form of an electuary. It has
been remarked, moreover, that even in our own climate, the caged
birds that are fed with hemp seed are the most amorously
inclined.</p>

<p>According to Browne<a name="FNanchor_157" id=
"FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
whole fields are in Africa sown with <i>hashish</i>, the
<i>bang</i> of the East Indies, for the purpose of being used as a
stimulant to amorous dalliance. It is used in a variety of forms,
but in none, it is supposed, more effectually than what in Arabic,
is called Maij&ucirc;n, a kind of electuary, in which both men and
women indulge to excess.</p>

<p>It is said that the Chinese, domesticated at Batavia, avail
themselves of a certain electuary for the purpose of stimulating
their appetite for sexual intercourse. This preparation, called by
them Affion, is chiefly composed of opium, and it is asserted that
its effect is so violent that a brutal passion supervenes and
continues throughout the night, the female being obliged to flee
from the too energetic embraces of her lover.<a name="FNanchor_158"
id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class=
"fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>Narcotics, in general, and especially, opium, have been
considered as direct aphrodisiacs, an opinion which, if well
founded, would enable us to account more easily far those agreeable
sensations by which the use of these substances is followed.</p>

<p>But it is very probable that narcotics act upon the genital
organs in no other way than they do upon the other ones, that is to
say, they certainly do simulate them, but only proportionately to
the increase of force in the circulation of the blood and to the
power or tone of the muscular fibre. It is also very <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>probable
that the voluptuous impressions superinduced by them depend upon
the circumstances under which those persons are, who habitually
indulge in them, and that they are connected with other impressions
or with particular ideas which awaken them. If, for instance, in a
Sultan reclining upon his sofa, the intoxication of opium is
accompanied by images of the most ravishing delight, and if it
occasions in him that sweet and lively emotion which the
anticipation of those delights awakens throughout the whole nervous
system, the same inebriation is associated in the mind of a
Janizary or a Spahi with ideas of blood and carnage, with
paroxysms, the brutal fury of which has certainly, nothing in
common with the tender emotions of love. It is in vain to allege in
proof of the aphrodisiacal qualities of opium the state of erection
in which the genital members of Turks are found when lying dead on
a field of battle,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a
href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> for this state
depends upon, or is caused by, the violent spasm or universal
convulsive movements with which the body is seized in the moment of
death: the same phenomenon frequently appears in persons who suffer
hanging. In warm countries, it is the concomitant of death from
convulsive diseases, and in our own climate, it has been observed
in persons who have died from apoplectic attacks.</p>

<p>The power which certain odours possess of exciting venereal
desires admits not the slightest doubt, at least as far as the
inferior animals are concerned. Nearly all the mammifera exhale or
emit, in the rutting season, peculiar emanations serving to
announce from afar to the male the presence of the female and to
excite in him the sexual desire. Facts have been observed <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>with
respect to insects even, which cannot be otherwise accounted for
than by odorous effluvia. If, for instance, the female of the
bombyx butterfly, be placed in a box accurately closed, it will not
be long before several males will be seen flying around the prison,
and which could not possibly have known, by means of their visual
organs, the presence of their captive Dulcinea. Now the question
is, does anything analogous take place in our own species? Many
authors assert that there does, and among them Virey, who, speaking
of such exhalations, says: "L'extr&ecirc;me propret&eacute; des
hommes et des femmes, l'habitude de se baigner et de changer
souvent de linge <i>font dispara&iuml;tre</i> les odeurs
g&eacute;nitales.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a
href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">60</a> ... On doit aussi
remarquer que la haire des C&eacute;nobites, la robe des Capucins,
le froc des moines, les v&ecirc;tements rudes et mal-propres de
diverses corporations religieuses exposent ceux qui les portent
&agrave; de fortes tentations, &agrave; cause de la qualit&eacute;
stimulante et de la sueur f&eacute;tide dont &eacute;taient
bient&ocirc;t empreintes toutes ces sortes d'habillements."<a name=
"FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class=
"fnanchor">161</a> "Odours," observes Cabanis<a name="FNanchor_162"
id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class=
"fnanchor">162</a> "act powerfully upon the nervous system, they
prepare it for all the pleasurable sensations; they communicate to
it that slight disturbance or commotion which appears as if
inseperable from emotions of delight, all which may be accounted
for by their exercising a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108"
id="Page_108">108</a></span>special action upon those organs whence
originate the most rapturous pleasure of which our nature is
susceptible. In infancy its influence is almost nothing, in old age
it is weak, its true epoch being that of youth, that of love."</p>

<p>It is certain that among most nations, and from the remotest
antiquity, voluptuous women strengthened their amorous propensities
by the use of various perfumes, but particularly of musk, to which
has been attributed the power of exciting nocturnal emissions. The
great Henry IV., of France, no novice in love affairs, was opposed
to the use of odours, maintaining that the parts of generation
should be allowed to retain their natural scent, which, in his
opinion, was more effectual than all the perfumes ever manufactured
by art.</p>

<p>Another aphrodisiacal remedy, which for a long time enjoyed a
great reputation was the penis of the stag, which was supposed to
possess the virtue of furnishing a man with an abundance of seminal
fluid. Perhaps the reason why the ancients attributed this property
to the genital member of that animal was from the supposition that
it was the receptacle of the bile; that the abundance and acrid
quality of this fluid caused lasciviousness, and that the stag
being transported by an erotic furor during the rutting season, he
was the most salacious of animals, and consequently that the
genital organ of this quadruped would, when applied to man's
generative apparatus, impart thereto considerable heat and
irritation. A somewhat similar opinion respecting the horse appears
to have obtained among the Tartars, if we may judge from the
following account given by Foucher d'Obsonville:<a name=
"FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class=
"fnanchor">163</a> "Les palefreniers am&eacute;nent un cheval de
sept &agrave; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id=
"Page_109">109</a></span>huit ans, mais nerveux, bien nourri et en
bon &eacute;tat. On lui pr&eacute;sente une jument comme pour la
saillir, et cependant on le retient de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; bien
irriter ses id&eacute;es. Enfin, dans le moment o&ugrave; il semble
qu'il va lui &ecirc;tre libre de s'&eacute;lancer dessus, l'on fait
adroitment passer la verge dans un cordon dont le n&oelig;ud
coulant est rapproch&eacute; au ventre, ensuite, saisissant
&agrave; l'instant o&ugrave; l'animal parait dans sa plus forte
&eacute;rection, deux hommes qui tiennent les
extr&eacute;mit&eacute;s du cordon le tirent avec force et, sur le
champ, le membre est s&eacute;par&eacute; du corps au dessus le
n&oelig;ud coulant. Par ce moyen, les esprits sont retenus et
fix&eacute;s dane cette partie laquelle rests gonfl&eacute;e;
aussit&ocirc;t on la lave et la fait cuire avec divers aromatiques
et &eacute;piceries aphrodisiaques."</p>

<p>The means of procuring the vigour necessary for sexual delights
has also been sought for in certain preparations celebrated by the
alchymists. Struck by the splendour of gold, its incorruptibility,
and other rare qualities, some physicians imagined that this metal
might introduce into the animal economy an inexhaustible source of
strength and vitality; while empirics, abusing the credulity of the
wealthy and the voluptuous made them pay exorbitantly for
aphrodisiacal preparations in which they assured their dupes that
gold, under different forms, was an ingredient. Among innumerable
other instances, is that of a French lady who, to procure herself
an heir, strove to reanimate an exhausted constitution by taking
daily in soup what she was made to believe was potable gold, to the
value of 50 francs, a fraud to expose which it suffices to say that
the largest dose of perchloride of gold that can be safely
administered is 1/6th of a grain. The tincture of gold known by the
name of <i>Mademoiselle Grimaldi's potable gold</i> enjoyed a
wonderful reputation towards the close of the 18th century as an
efficacious restorative and stimulant; and numerous instances of
its all but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id=
"Page_110">110</a></span> miraculous powers were confidently
adduced. Dr. Samuel Johnson, indeed, in a note upon a well-known
passage in Shakespeare,<a name="FNanchor_164" id=
"FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
denies the possibility of making gold potable: "There has long," he
observes, "prevailed an opinion that a solution of gold has great
medicinal virtues, and that the incorruptibility of gold might be
communicated to the body impregnated with it. Some have pretended
to make gold <i>potable</i> among other frauds practised upon
credulity." So far back, however, as the 17th century the
Abb&eacute; Guence shewed that it was feasible, and even described
the process minutely; and it is now known to every chemist that
gold is susceptible of entering into immediate combination with
chlorine by the agency of heat, that it may even be dissolved in
water charged with chlorine, and that various methods exist of
obtaining chlorate of gold, a combination which is often
successfully employed in the treatment of syphilitic cases. Ether,
naptha, and essential oils take gold from its solvent, and form
liquors which have been called <i>potable</i> gold.</p>

<p>Even the Christian Church itself possessed, in its early times,
aphrodisiacs peculiarly its own. "On trouve," says Voltaire,<a
name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165"
class="fnanchor">165</a> "dans la lettre &agrave; Maitre Acacius

<p>Bourchard, Bishop of Worms, has transmitted to us<a name=
"FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class=
"fnanchor">166</a> an account of certain aphrodisiacal charms
practised by women of his time, the disgusting obscenity of which
is such that we cannot venture upon translating the passage:</p>

<p>"Fecisti quod qu&aelig;dam mulieres facere solent? Tollunt
menstruum suum sanguinem et immiscunt cibo vel potui et dant viris
suis ad manducandum vel ad bibendum ut plus diligantur ab eis. Si
fecisti, quinque annos per legitimas ferias p&oelig;niteas.</p>

<p>"Gustasti de semine viri tui ut propter tua diabolica facta plus
in amorem exardisceret? Si fecisti, septem annos per legitimas
ferias p&oelig;nitere debeas.</p>

<p>"Fecisti quod qu&aelig;dam mulieres facere solent? Prosternunt
se in faciem et discoopertis natibus, jubent ut supra nudas nates
conficirtur panis, ut eo decocto tradunt maritis suis ad
comedendum. Hoc ideo faciunt ut plus exardescant in amorem suum. Si
fecisti, duos annos per legitimas ferias p&oelig;niteas.</p>

<p>"Fecisti quad qu&aelig;dam mulieres facere solent? Tollunt
piscem vivum et mittunt eum in puerperium suum, et tamdiu ibi

suis ad comedendum tradunt. Ideo faciunt ut plus in amorem suum
exardescant. Si fecisti, duos annos per legitimas ferias
p&oelig;niteas."</p>

<p>Remedies taken internally are not the only ones which stimulate
man to sexual intercourse. External applications materially
contribute to that end, and liniments have been composed <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id=

generation. These washes are made of honey, liquid storax, oil and
fresh butter, or the fat of the wild goose, together with a small
quantity of spurge, pyrethrum, ginger or pepper to insure the
remedy's penetrating: a few grains of ambergris, musk, or cinnamon
are to be added by way of perfume.</p>

<p>Remedies for the same purpose may also be applied to men's
testicles especially; as according to the opinion of Galen, those
parts are the second source of heat, which they communicate to the
whole of the body; for, besides the power of engendering, they also
elaborate a spirituous humour or fluid which renders man robust,
hardy, and courageous. The best application of this kind is that
composed of cinnamon powder, gilliflower, ginger and rose water,
together with theriac, the crumb of bread, and red wine.</p>

<p>In addition to the means already mentioned for restoring vigour
to the generative organs, two others may be reckoned which have
been successfully resorted to for bracing them in such persons
whose reproductive faculties lie dormant rather than extinct: these
two methods are known as <i>flagellation</i> and
<i>urtication</i>.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a
href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>Flagellation was recommended by several of the ancient
physicians as an effectual remedy in many disorders, and this upon
the physiological axiom of Hippocrates&mdash;<i>ubi stimulus, ibi
affluxus</i>. Seneca considers it as able to remove the quartan
ague. Jerome Mercurialis speaks of it as employed by many
physicians in order to impart embonpoint to thin, meagre persons;
and Galen informs us that slave merchants used it as a means of
clearing the complexion of their slaves and plumping <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>them up.
Al&aelig;deus of Padua, recommends flagellation with green nettles,
that is, urtication, to be performed on the limbs of young children
for the purpose of hastening the eruption of the small pox. Thomas
Campanella<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> attributes to flagellation
the virtue of curing intestinal obstructions, and adduces in proof
to his assertion, the case of the Prince of Venosa, one of the best
musicians of his time, who could not go to stool, without being
previously flogged by a valet kept expressly for that purpose.</p>

<p>Even at a later period the same opinion obtained as to the
efficacy of flagellation, it being supposed by many physicians to
reanimate the torpid circulation of the capillary and cutaneous
vessels, to increase muscular energy, to promote absorption, and to
favour the necessary secretions of our nature.<a name=
"FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class=
"fnanchor">169</a> As an erotic stimulant, more particularly it may
be observed that, considering the many intimate and sympathetic
relations existing between the nervous branches of the extremity of
the spinal marrow, it is impossible to doubt that flagellation
exercised upon the buttocks and the adjacent parts, has a powerful
effect upon the organs of generation.</p>

<p>Meibomius,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> the great advocate for the
use of this remedy, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id=
"Page_114">114</a></span>remarks, that stripes inflicted upon the
back and loins are of great utility in exciting the venereal
appetite, because they create warmth in those parts whose office it
is to elaborate the semen and to convey it to the generative
organs. He, therefore, considered it by no means wonderful that the
miserable victims of debauchery and lasciviousness, as well as
those whose powers have been exhausted by age or excess, should
have recourse to flagellation as a remedy. He observes that its
effect is very likely to be that of renewing warmth in the now
frigid parts, and of furnishing heat to the semen, an effect in
producing which the pain itself materially contributes by the blood
and heat which is thereby drawn down to the part until they are
communicated to the reproductive organs, the erotic passion being
thus raised, even in spite of nature herself, beyond her powers. A
similar view is taken by a modern writer, whose opinion is "that
the effect of flagellation may be easily referred to the powerful
sympathy which exists between the nerves of the lower part of the
spinal marrow and other organs. Artificial excitement appears in
some degree natural; it is observed in several animals, especially
in the feline race. Even snails plunge into each other a bony,
prickly spur, that arises from their throats, and which, like the
sting of the wasp, frequently breaks off, and is left in the
wound."<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>After the appearance of the Abb&eacute; Boileau's <i>Histoire de
la Flagellation</i>, the Jesuits condemned several propositions
found either in that work or in others approved by him. The
following is one:</p>

<p>"Necesse est cum musculi lumbares virgis aut flagellis
diverberantur, spiritus vitales revelli, adeoque salaces motus ob
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id=
"Page_115">115</a></span>vicinam partium genitalium et testium
excitari, qui venereis ac illecebris cerebrum mentemque fascinant
ac virtutem castitatis ad extremas augustias redigunt."</p>

<p>From out of almost innumerable instances of the efficacy of
flagellation as an aphrodisiac, the following are selected.</p>

<p>Cornelius Gallus, the friend of Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, and
Catullus, and who, according to Pliny, died the most delightful of
deaths by expiring in the embraces of the fondest object of his
affections,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> was solely indebted for
the delicious transports he enjoyed with her to the scourge with
which her severe father chastised her for the faults that
originated in too warm a temperament, a punishment which, instead
of counteracting, furthered the wishes of the voluptuous Roman.</p>

<p>Jean Pic de Mirandole relates<a name="FNanchor_173" id=
"FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>
the case of a person known to him who, being a great libertine,
could not consummate the act of love without being flagellated
until the blood came, and that, therefore, providing himself for
the occasion with a whip steeped in vinegar, he presented it to his
<i>inamorata</i>, begging her not to spare him, for "plus on le
fouettait, plus il y trouvait des d&eacute;lices, la douleur et la
volupt&eacute; marchant, dans cet homme, d'un pas egal."</p>

<p>Meibomius mentions the case of a citizen of Lubeck who, being
accused and convicted of adultery, was sentenced to be banished. A
woman of pleasure with whom this man had</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id=
"Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>been for a long time intimate, appeared before the judges as a
witness on his behalf. This woman swore that the man was never able
to consummate the act of love with her unless he had been
previously flogged,&mdash;an operation which it was also necessary
to repeat before each successive indulgence.</p>

<p>That this was a means employed by Abelard in his commerce with
Heloisa, appears from the following passages in two of his letters
to her;</p>

<p>"Verbera quandoque dabat amor non furor, gratia non ira
qu&aelig; omnium unguentorum suavitatem transcenderent."<a name=
"FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class=
"fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>"Stripes which, whenever inflicted by love, not by fury but
affection, transcended, in sweetness, every unguent."</p>

<p>"Nosti quantis turpitudinibus immoderata mea libido corpora
nostra addixerat et nulla honestatis vel Dei reverentia in ipsis
diebus Dominic&aelig; passionis vel quantarumque solemnitatem ut
hujus luti volutabro me revocavit. Sed et te nolentem aut
dissuadentem qu&aelig; natura infirmior eras, ut s&aelig;pius minis
ac flagellis ad consensum trahebam.<a name="FNanchor_175" id=
"FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class=
"fnanchor">175</a>"</p>

<p>"Thou knowest to what shameful excesses my unbridled lust had
delivered up our bodies, so that no sense of decency, no reverence
for God, could, even in the season of our Lord's passion, or during
any other holy festival, drag me forth from out that cesspool of
filthy mire; but that even with threats and scourges I often
compelled thee who wast, by nature, the weaker vessel, to comply,
notwithstanding thy unwillingness and remonstrances."</p>

<p>The renowned Tamerlane, the mighty conqueror of Asia, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id=
"Page_117">117</a></span>required a like stimulus,<a name=
"FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class=
"fnanchor">176</a> the more so perhaps from the circumstance of his
being a monorchis.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a
href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Boileau, in his well known and entertaining
"Histoire des Flagellants," partly attributes the gross
licentiousness of that period to the strange practice then in vogue
of doing penance by being scourged in public; and his brother the
celebrated poet and critic, defending the Abb&eacute; against the
animadversions of the Jesuits, remarks very forcibly:</p>

<p>Flagellation, indeed, as well as the custom of wearing the
hair-shirt, so common with the monks, and even with religious lay
catholics, was, by the stimulus it imparted to the skin, and hence
to the internal viscera, much more likely to increase the <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
energy of the physiological functions, and <i>thus excite the
commission of the very acts they are intended to suppress</i>.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Chuppe d'Auteroche, member of the
Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, and who died in California a few days
after the observation of the Transit of Venus in 1760, remarks that
the stripes given to persons frequenting the vapour baths in Russia
impart activity to the fluids and elasticity to the organs and
gives additional stimulus to the venereal appetite.<a name=
"FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class=
"fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>M. Serrurier records the following curious case. "One of my
schoolfellows, who found an indescribable pleasure in being
flogged, purposely and wilfully neglected his duty in order to draw
upon himself the correction, which never failed to produce an
emission of semen. As may easily be imagined he soon began the
practice of masturbation, in which he indulged to so frightful an
extent that rapid consumption ensued, and he died, a most horrible
and disgusting object, affording a melancholy example of that fatal
vice."<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>The case of Jean Jacques Rousseau is well known. When a child he
was by no means displeased with the corrections administered to him
by a lady considerably his elder, he even frequently sought for a
whipping at her hands, especially after he perceived that the
flagellation developed in him the manifest token of virility. But
he must be allowed to give his own account of it. "Assez long
temps," says he, "Madame Lambercier s'entint &agrave; la menace, et
cette menace d'un ch&acirc;timent tout nouveau pour moi me semblait
tr&egrave;s effrayante, mais apr&egrave;s l'ex&eacute;cution, je la
trouvai moins terrible &agrave; l'&eacute;preuve que l'attente
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id=
"Page_119">119</a></span>ne l'avait &eacute;t&eacute;, et ce qu'il
y a de plus bizarre est qui ce ch&acirc;timent m'affectionna
davantage d'elle qui me l'avoit impos&eacute;. Il fallait
m&ecirc;me toute la v&eacute;rit&eacute; de cette affection et
toute ma douceur naturelle pour m'emp&ecirc;cher de chercher le
retour du m&ecirc;me traitement en le m&eacute;ritant, car j'avais
trouv&eacute; dans la douleur, dans la honte m&ecirc;me, un
m&eacute;lange de sensualit&eacute; qui m'avait laiss&eacute; plus
de d&eacute;sir que de crainte de l'&eacute;prouver derechef, par
la m&ecirc;me main. Il est vrai que comme il se m&ecirc;lait, sans
doute, &agrave; cela quelque instinct pr&eacute;coce du sexe, le
m&ecirc;me ch&acirc;timent re&ccedil;u de son fr&egrave;re, ne
m'eut point du tout, parut plaisant."<a name="FNanchor_181" id=
"FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class=
"fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>As flagellation is practised by striking the skin with a rod
formed of twigs, until the heat and redness become more intense, so
if the twigs be replaced by fresh nettles, the operation will
become,&mdash;<i>urtication</i>.</p>

<p>The employment of urtication is of great antiquity, for Celsus
as well as Aret&aelig;us mentions the use of it, it being in those
times, a popular remedy. That the Romans had frequent recourse to
it in order to arouse the sexual appetite, is proved by the
following passage from Petronius Arbiter, which for obvious
reasons, we shall content ourselves with giving in the original
only. "Oenothea semiebria ad me respiciens;&mdash;Perficienda sunt,
inquit, mysteria <i>ut recipas nervos</i>.</p>

<p>"Simulque profert scorteum fascinum quod, ut olio et minuto
pipere, atque <i>urtic&aelig;</i> trito circumdedit semine,

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id=

<p>Menghus Faventinus assures us that nettles have "une
propri&eacute;t&eacute; merveilleuse pour allonger, tendre, grossir
et &eacute;riger le membre viril, qui, par une parsimonie de la

<p>Urtication appears to have been well known in France during the
time of Rabelais, who alluding to this mode of procuring the vigour
necessary for the amorous conflict, says, "se frotter le cul au
panicaut (a species of thistle) vrai moyen d'avoir au cul
passion."</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>The irritation caused by nettles produces effects analogous to
those which are observed in persons afflicted with the itch, the
ring-worm and leprosy. The lubricity of those unfortunates is
sometimes uncontrolable; they suffer violent priapisms, which are
followed by ejaculation, whenever a severe itching forces them to
scratch themselves with a kind of furor or madness.</p>

<p>"In a medical point of view," observes Dr. Milligen,
"urtication, or stinging with nettles, is a practice not
sufficiently appreciated. In many instances, especially in cases of
paralysis it is more efficacious than blistering or stimulating
frictions. Its effects, though perhaps less permanent, are general
and diffused over the limb. This process has been found effectual
in restoring <i>heat to the lower extremities</i>, and a case of
obstinate lethargy was cured by Corvisart by a repeated urtication
of the whole body. During the action of the stimulus, the patient,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id=
"Page_121">121</a></span>who was a young man, would open his eyes
and laugh, but then sink again into a profound sleep. In three
weeks, however, his perfect cure was effected.<a name=

<p>In 1783, Dr. James Graham, an humble imitator of the celebrated
Cagliostro, commenced giving his sanatary lectures, which he
illustrated by the dazzling presence of his Goddess of Health, a
character which, for a short time, was sustained by Emma Harte,
afterwards the celebrated Lady Hamilton, wife of Sir William
Hamilton, English Ambassador at the Court of Naples, and the
<i>ch&egrave;re amie</i> of the immortal Nelson.</p>

<p>After describing various aphrodisiacal remedies, the lecturer
thus proceeds: "But, gentlemen, if all the above means and methods,
which I have thus faithfully, ingenuously, and with the frankest
and most unreserved liberality, recommended, fail, suffer me, with
great cordiality, and assurance of success, to recommend my
celestial, or medico, magnetico, musico, electrical bed, which I
have, with so much study and at so vast an expense, constructed,
not alone to insure the removal of barrenness, when conception is
at all in the nature of things possible, but likewise to improve,
exalt, and invigorate the bodily, and through them, the mental
faculties of the human species. This bed, whose seemingly
<i>magical</i> influences are now celebrated from pole to pole and
from the rising to the setting sun! is indeed an <i>unique</i> in
science! and unquestionably the first and the only one that ever
was mentioned, erected, or even, perhaps, thought of, in the world;
and I will now conclude the lecture with giving you a slight
descriptive sketch of the structure of the bed, and the nature of
those influences with which it glows&mdash;which it breathes forth,
and with which it animates, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>regenerates, and transports
those happy, happy persons who have the honour and the paradisiacal
blessedness of reposing on it.</p>

<p>"The Grand Celestial State Bed! then, gentlemen, which is twelve
feet long by nine wide, is supported by forty pillars of brilliant
glass, of great strength and of the most exquisite workmanship, in
regard to shape, cutting, and engravings; sweetly delicate and
richly variegated colours, and the most brilliant polish! They are,
moreover, invisibly incrusted with a certain transparent varnish in
order to render the insulation still more complete; and that
otherwise, properly assisted, we may have, in even the most
unfavourable weather, abundance of the electrical fire.</p>

<p>"The sublime, the magnificent, and, I may say, the
super-celestial dome of the bed, which contains the odoriferous,
balmy, and ethereal spices, odours, and essences, and which is the
grand magazine or reservoir of those vivifying and invigorating
influences which are exhaled and dispersed by the breathing of the
music, and by the attenuating, repelling, and accelerating force of
the electrical fire,&mdash;is very curiously inlaid or wholly
covered on the under side with brilliant plates of looking-glass,
so disposed as to reflect the various attractive charms of the
happy recumbent couple, in the most flattering, most agreeable and
most enchanting style.</p>

<p>"On the top or summit of the dome, are placed, in the most
loving attitudes, two exquisite figures, representing the marriage
of Cupid and Psyche, with a fine figure of Hymen behind, and over
them, with his torch flaming with electrical fire in one hand and,
with the other, supporting a celestial crown, sparkling, likewise,
with the effulgent fire over a pair of real living turtle-doves,
who, on a little bed of roses, coo and bill under the
super-animating impulses of the genial fire! The other elegant
groups<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id=
"Page_123">123</a></span> of figures which sport on the top of the
dome&mdash;the Cupids, the Loves, and the Graces!&mdash;besides
festoons of the freshest and most beautiful flowers, have each of
them musical instruments in their hands, which by the exquisite and
most expensive mechanism, are made to breathe forth sounds
corresponding with the appearance of the several
instruments,&mdash;flutes, guitars, violins, clarionets, trumpets,
horns, oboes, kettle-drums, &amp;c. On the posts or pillars, too,
which support the grand dome are groups of figures, musical
instruments, organ-pipes, &amp;c., which, in sweet concert with the
other instruments, at the commencement of the tender dalliance of
the happy pair, breathe forth celestial sounds! lulling them in
visions of elysian joys! opening new sources of pleasure, and
"untwisting all the chains which tie the hidden soul of harmony!"
At the head of the bed, in the full centre front, appears,
sparkling with electrical fire, through a glory of burnished and
effulgent gold, the great, first, ever-operating commandment, <span
class="smcap">Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the
earth!</span> under this is a most elegant and sweet-toned organ,
in the front of which is a fine landscape of moving figures on the
earth, birds flying, swans, &amp;c., gliding on the waters, a fine
procession, too, is seen, village nymphs strewing flowers before
priests, brides, bridegrooms, and their attendants, who, all
entering into the temple of Hymen, disappear from the delightful
eye. The painting and embellishment of this front are most
masterly, and reflect the highest honour on the artists by whom
they were executed; and the whole view is terminated with
fountains, waterfalls, shepherds, shepherdesses, and other
peasants, as pastoral sports and rural employment, and by a little
church, the dial of which points out truly and distinctly the
hour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id=
"Page_124">124</a></span>"In the celestial bed no feather bed is
employed; sometimes mattresses filled with sweet new wheat or cut
straw, with the grain in the ears, and mingled with balm, rose
leaves, lavender flowers, and oriental spices, and, at other times,
springy hair mattresses are used. Neither will you find upon the
celestial bed linen sheets; our sheets are of the richest and
softest silk or satin; of various colours suited to the complexion
of the lady who is to repose on them. Pale green, for example, rose
colour, sky blue, black, white, purple, azure, mazarin blue,
&amp;c., and they are sweetly perfumed in the oriental manner, with
otto and odour of roses, jessamine, tuberose, rich gums, fragrant
balsams, oriental spices, &amp;c.,; in short, everything is done to
assist the ethereal, magnetic, musical and electric influences, and
to make the lady look as lovely as possible in the eyes of her
husband and he, in hers. But to return, in order that I might have
for the important purposes, the strongest and most springy hair, I
procured, at a vast expense, the tails of English stallions, which
when twisted, baked and then untwisted and properly prepared, is
elastic to the highest degree.</p>

<p>"But the chief elastic principle of my celestial bed is produced
by artificial loadstones. About fifteen hundred pounds' weight of
artificial and compound magnets are so disposed and arranged as to
be continually pouring forth in an ever-flowing circle
inconceivable and irrestibly powerful tides of the magnetic
effluxion, which is well known to have a very strong affinity with
the electric fire.</p>

<p>"Such is a slight and inadequate sketch of the grand celestial
bed, which, being thus completely insulated,&mdash;highly saturated
with the most genial floods or electrical fire!&mdash;fully
impregnated moreover, with the balmy vivifying effluvia of
restorative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id=
"Page_125">125</a></span> balsamic medicines and of soft, fragrant,
oriental gums, balsams and quintescence, and pervaded at the same
times with full springing tides of the invigorating influences of
music and magnets both real and artificial, gives such elastic
vigour to the nerves, on the one hand, of the male, and on the
other, such retentive firmness to the female; and, moreover, all
the faculties of the soul being so fully expanded, and so highly
illuminated, that it is impossible, in the nature of things, but
that strong, beautiful, brilliant, nay, double-distilled children,
if I may use the expression, must infallibly be begotten."</p>

<p>A digression may, perhaps, be here pardonable, in order to give
some notice of the latter and last days of the beautiful, highly
accomplished and fascinating woman mentioned above.</p>

<p>She had been presented to Nelson by her husband, who had
previously told her that he was about to introduce her to a little
<i>thread-paper</i> of a man, who could not boast of being very
handsome, but who would become, some day, one of the greatest men
that England ever produced. After the battle of the Nile he again
visited Naples, and was now little better than a perfect wreck. At
Calvi, in 1794, he had lost an eye. At Teneriffe his right arm was
shattered and amputated close to the shoulder. At the battle of the
Nile he was severely wounded in the head. Incessant anxiety and
watchfulness for his country's honour and welfare had blanched his
brow, and shattered the "little thread-paper of a man" at the
outset, till, on his return in triumph to his mistress, he seemed
to be on the verge of an early grave.</p>

<p>Yet she proved herself a true woman, if an erring one, in her
reception of the man she loved, and unhesitatingly and
unequivocally forsook her all, to attend upon and worship him.</p>

house of Nelson and his mistress. It was left with all its
liabilities to Lady Hamilton, but she was obliged to take a hasty
departure, and, harassed by creditors, in sickness of heart and
without funds, the unhappy woman escaped to Calais.</p>

<p>Now for the sad, sad finale. From the portal of a house, as
cheerless and dreary as can be imagined, in the month of January,
with a black silk petticoat stretched on a white curtain thrown
over her coffin for a pall, and an half-day Irish dragoon to act as
chaplain over the grave, which was in a timber-yard, were the
remains of Nelson's much-adored friend removed to their final
resting place, under the escort of a <i>sergent de ville</i>.</p>

<p>She died without the common necessaries of life, and was buried
at the expense of the town, notwithstanding Nelson's last words,
"<i>Blackwood, take care of my poor Lady Hamilton!</i>"</p>

<p>"Whatever the errors of Lady Hamilton may have been," says
Doran, "let us not forget that without her aid, as Nelson said, the
battle of the Nile would never have been fought, and that in spite
of her sacrifices and services, England left her to starve, because
the government was too virtuous to acknowledge the benefits
rendered to her country by a lady with too loose a zone."<br />

<p>The remarks of honest old Burton<a name="FNanchor_187" id=

upon Aphrodisiacs, though quaint, are so judicious and pertinent,
that we cannot better conclude this part of our essay than by
quoting them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The last battering engines," says he, "are philters, amulets,
charms, images, and such unlawful meanes: if they cannot prevail of
themselves by the help of bawds, panders, and their <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>adherents,
they will fly for succour to the devil himself. I know there be
those that denye the devil can do any such thing, and that there is
no other fascination than that which comes by the eyes. It was
given out, of old, that a Thessalian wench had bewitched King
Philip to dote on her, and by philters enforced his love, but when
Olympia, his queen, saw the maid of an excellent beauty well
brought up and qualified: these, quoth she, were the philters which
enveagled King Philip, these the true charms as Henry to
Rosamond."<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href=

<h4>ANTI-APHRODISIACS.</h4>

<p>The means best calculated to produce effects contrary to those
just treated of are of several kinds, but such as are derived from
hygiene are entitled to be considered as the most powerful.
Previously, however, to describing the medicinal substances that
may be efficaciously employed in moderating, or rather checking,
too violent a propensity to venery, some notice must be taken of
the diet adapted to insure such a result.</p>

<p>The use of milk, vegetables, such as lettuce, water-purslain,
cucumbers, &amp;c., and especially of fruit in which the acid
principle predominates, slackens the movement of the heart and of
the sanguineous system; it diminishes the animal heat, the chief
source of which is in the activity of the circulation; it produces
a feeling of tranquillity and of coolness; the respiration being
more slow, occasions the absorption of a less quantity of oxygen,
add to which, as a less quantity of reparative materials is
contained in this description of aliments, there result a less
active nutrition, the loss of embonpoint and the complete
prostration of every principle of irritability; in short, it is of
all diets the one least capable of furnishing fuel to the passions.
For common drink mere water, and, if the impulse of passion should
increase, a small quantify of nitre, vinegar, or vitrolic acid,
may, occasionally be added to the water to make it more
cooling.</p>

<p>Other means conducive to the same end are a laborious life, much
bodily exercise, little sleep, and a spare diet, so that the fluids
may be more easily conducted to other parts, and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span> that
there may not be produced a greater quantity than is requisite for
the support of the body. Equally valuable</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i05">"When there's a young and
sweating devil</span> <span class="i0">That commonly
rebels,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>will be found what Shakespeare recommends&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i05">"A sequester from liberty,
fasting and prayer,</span> <span class="i0">Much castigation,
exercise devout."<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a
href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Should the desire of committing excesses rise to any height,
immediate recourse must be had to some serious and mind-absorbing
occupation, less nutritious food and drink should be taken, all
dishes peculiarly stimulating to the palate avoided, as well as the
use of wine and other spirituous liquors.</p>

<p>A cool regimen in every respect was particularly insisted upon
by the ancients: hence Plato and Aristotle recommended the custom
of going barefoot as a means of checking the stimulus to carnal
desire, a suggestion which appears to have been acted upon by some
of the monkish orders. The cold bath was considered equally
efficacious, while some, among whom may be reckoned Pliny and
Galen, advised thin sheets of lead to be worn on the calves of the
legs and near the kidneys.</p>

<p>The first and most important of the hygienic means consists in
shunning every species of excitement and in having little or no
communication with the sex, and the earlier such restraint is
imposed, the better. "He that is chaste and continent, not to
impair his strength, or terrified by contagion, will hardly be
heroically virtuous. Adjourn not that virtue until those years when
Cato could lend out his wife, and impotent satyrs write satires
against lust&mdash;but be chaste in thy flaming days, when
Alexander dared not trust his eyes upon the fair sisters of <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id=
"Page_130">130</a></span>Darius, and when so many men think that
there is no other way than that of Origen."<a name="FNanchor_191"
id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class=
"fnanchor">191</a> <a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a> <a
href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>The next means is that of carefully abstaining from the perusal
of all publications calculated to inflame the passions, by which
publications are meant, not obscene books only. With respect to
these, indeed, a great error obtains, for the persons most anxious
to peruse them are, for the most part, old, worn-out debauchees,
men whose generative powers are, comparatively, feeble, if not
altogether destroyed, and who, unfortunately for themselves,
require this unnatural and detestable kind of stimulus, while, on
the contrary, young men and those in middle life, who had not drawn
too largely upon their constitution, and for whom the allurements
of nature are themselves a sufficient provocative, regard such
publications with horror and disgust. It is not, therefore, we
repeat, works of this description which we allude to, but those the
perusal of which is more dangerous during the period of the
passions&mdash;novels, more especially such as, under the pretext
of describing the working of the human heart, draw the most
seducing and inflammatory pictures of illicit love, and throw the
veil of sentimental philosophy over the orgies of debauchery and
licentiousness. Nothing is more perilous to youth, especially of
the female sex, than this description of books. Their style is
chaste, not one word is found <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>that can offend the ear,
while the mind of the unsuspecting reader is often tainted and
corrupted by the most impure ideas and descriptions clothed in the
most elegant phraseology. How admirably does Voltaire stigmatise
this attention to a mere superficial (if the epitaph be allowed)
purity! "Plus," says he "les m&oelig;urs sont
d&eacute;prav&eacute;s, plus les expressions deviennent
m&eacute;sur&eacute;es: on croit de gagner en langage ce qu'on a
perdu en vertu. La pudeur s'est enfuite des c&oelig;urs et s'est
refugi&eacute;e sur les l&egrave;vres."</p>

<p>There are two kinds of study particularly adapted to preserve
the mind and the affections from the assaults of vice and
libidinousness. The first of these is the <i>Mathematics</i>, whose
efficacy in this respect has been proved by frequent experience.
The Venetian lady mentioned by Rousseau in his "Confessions" was
not ignorant of this their power, when, seeing the singular effect
which her charms had produced upon the, as yet, youthful
philosopher, said to him, "<i>Gianetto, lascia le donne e studia la
matimatica</i>." "James, give up the ladies, and apply yourself to
mathematics." It will, indeed, be found that, in all ages,
mathematicians have been but little disposed or addicted to love,
and the most celebrated among them, Sir Isaac Newton, is reputed to
have lived without ever having had sexual intercourse. The intense
mental application required by philosophical abstraction forcibly
determines the nervous fluid towards the intellectual organs, and
hinders it from being directed towards those of reproduction.</p>

<p>After the study of the Mathematics comes that of <i>Natural
History</i>, which will be found to be almost equally beneficial,
requiring as it does, the unremitting attention of the student, his
perambulation of the open country, and the personal observation of
all animated objects.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id=
"Page_132">132</a></span>This peculiar influence of the
above-mentioned studies ought particularly to engage the attention
of persons who superintend the education of youth; there being no
doubt that the effervescence of youthful passions may, to a great
extent, be allayed by directing the juvenile mind to either of
those studies, according as the constitution exhibits greater or
less ardour and precocity. Sometimes, however, there are found
idiosyncrasies which bid defiance to remedies of this description,
but, nevertheless, yield to the force of medicine: of such, the
following is an instance:</p>

<p>"A man, by profession a musician, of an athletic figure and
sanguine complexion, with red hair, and a very warm temperament,
was so tormented with erotic desires that the venereal act,
repeated several times in the course of a few hours, failed to
satisfy him. Disgusted with himself, and fearing, as a religious
man, the punishment with which concupiscence is threatened in the
Gospel, he applied to a medical practitioner, who prescribed
bleeding and the use of sedatives and refrigerants, together with a
light diet. Having found no relief from this course of treatment,
he was then recommended to have recourse to wedlock, and, in
consequence, married a robust and healthy young woman, the daughter
of a farmer. At first, the change appeared to benefit him, but, in
a short time, he tired his wife out by his excessive lubricity, and
relapsed into his former satyriasis. His medical friend now
recommended frequent fasting, together with prayer, but these also
failing of effect, the unhappy man proposed to submit to
castration, an operation which was judged to be highly improper,
considering the great risks the patient must necessarily incur. The
latter, however, still persisted that his wish should be complied
with, when, fortunately, a case having occurred in Paris, in which
a person afflicted with neph<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>ritic pains occasioned by
the presence of a calculus, was cured by a preparation of nitre, at
the expense, however, of being for ever incapacitated for the
pleasures of love, the hint was taken, and doses of nitre dissolved
in <i>aqua nymph&aelig;</i> were given, night and morning, during
the space of eight days, and with such success that, at the end of
that time, he could scarcely satisfy the moderate claims of his
wife."<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>Some physicians place great confidence in the medicines called
refrigerants. The most favourite of these are infusions from the
leaves or flowers of the white water-lily (<i>nymphea alba</i>),
sorrel, lettuce, perhaps also from mallows, violets, and endive
(cichorium), oily seeds, and waters distilled from lettuce, water
lily, cucumbers, purslain, and endives. In equal esteem are the
syrups of orgeat, lemons, and vinegar, to which may be added
cherry-laurel water, when given in proper and gradually-increasing
doses. Hemlock, camphor, and agnus-castus, have likewise been much
recommended as moderators of the sexual appetite.</p>

<p>According to Pliny,<a name="FNanchor_194" id=
"FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
the nymphea alba was considered so powerful that these who take it
for twelve days successively will then find themselves incapable of
propagating their species, and if it be used for forty days, the
amorous propensity will be entirely extinguished.</p>

<p>With respect to hemlock, it is too dangerous a medicine to
repose confidence in.</p>

<p>The ancients had a high opinion of camphor, a reputation which
this drug preserved until, comparatively, a late period, for
Scaliger informs that, in the 17th century, monks were compelled to
smell and masticate it for the purpose of extinguishing <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id=
"Page_134">134</a></span>concupiscence; and it was a favourite
maxim of the medical school of Salernum<a name="FNanchor_195" id=
"FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Camphora per nares castrat
odore mares."</span></div>
</div>

<div class="poem3">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">Camphor if smell'd</span>
<span class="i0">A man will geld.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This fatal property, however, has been denied by modern medical
authorities, and apparently with reason, if the fact be true that
such workmen as are employed in extracting this useful vegetable
product, and who may be said to live constantly in a highly
camphorated atmosphere, do not find themselves in the leash degree
incapacitated for gratifying the calls of <i>l'amour
physique</i>.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, on the other hand, that camphor has been
successfully employed in cases of nymphomania, and that several
medical writers have asserted its efficacy in neutralising the
properties of cantharides, adducing instances which would appear to
prove its sedative power: the following one is related by
Groenvelt:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a
href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>A young man who had taken a large dose of cantharides in some
wine, felt at first, a sort of violent itching, accompanied by
great irritation in the bladder, and soon after he suffered <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id=
"Page_135">135</a></span>greatly from extreme heat, together with
an intolerable strangury. Bleeding, emulsions, injections, and
opium preparations afforded not the slightest relief. Groenvelt
prescribed two scruples of camphor in two boluses. The first dose
partly mitigated the pains, and the second one removed them
entirely. The remedies which were first administered had, no doubt,
weakened the inflammation, and the strangury being no longer kept
up by the spasmodic state of the urinary apparatus, camphor
sufficed to effect a cure. Burton asserts the value of camphor as
an anti-aphrodisiac, and says that when fastened to the parts of
generation, or carried in the breeches, it renders the virile
member flaccid.</p>

<p>Agnus castus, so called from the down on its surface resembling
that upon the skin of a lamb, and from its supposed
anti-aphrodisiacal qualities, was in great repute among the
Athenians, whose women, during the celebration of the Thesmophoria,
or feasts and sacrifices in honour of Ceres or Thesmophoria, the
legislatress, abstained for some days from all the pleasures of
love, separating themselves entirely for that time from the men. It
was also usual with them during the solemnities to strew their beds
with agnus castus, fleabane, and other herbs as were supposed to
have the power of expelling amorous inclinations. Arnaud de
Villeneuve<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> exaggerates, almost to a
ridiculous degree, the virtue of the agnus castus, asserting as he
does, that the surest way to preserve chastity, is to carry about
the person, a knife with a handle made of its wood. It was also,
and per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id=
"Page_136">136</a></span>haps is still, much used by the monks, who
made an emulsion of its seeds steeped in Nenuphar water, and of
which they daily drank a portion, wearing at the same time round
their loins a girdle made of its branches. Lettuce has also the
reputation of being anti-aphrodisiacal. Lobel instances the case of
an English nobleman who had long been desirous of having an heir to
his estates, but all in vain. Being, however, at length advised to
discontinue eating lettuces, of which he was particularly fond, his
wishes were gratified by his being blessed with a numerous
offspring.</p>

<p>The desire for coition was also supposed to be diminished by
drinking a decoction of the pounded leaves of the willow. Vervain,
dried coriander, and also mustard, drunk in a fluid state, are also
said to prevent the erection of the penis. Alexander Benedictus
declares that a topaz having been previously rubbed against the
right testicle of a wolf, then steeped in oil or in rose water and
worn as a ring, induces a disgust for venereal pleasures, as does
also, if we may credit the same sapient physiologist, a powder made
of dried frog. The two following prescriptions are also said to be
of great efficacy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Da verbena in potu, et non erigitur virga sex diebus. Utere
menth&acirc; sicc&acirc; cum aceto: genitalia illinita succo
hyoscyami aut cicut&aelig; coit&ucirc;s appetitum sedant."</p>

<p>It has even been asserted that coffee possesses the same
property. In the year 1695 it was maintained, in a thesis at the
Ecole de M&eacute;dicine at Paris, that the daily use of coffee
deprived both man and woman of the generative power. M. Hecquet<a
name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198"
class="fnanchor">198</a> relates the following anecdote as a proof
of such effect:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id=
"Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>A Queen of Persia seeing some grooms using all their efforts to
throw a horse upon the ground, enquired the reason of the trouble
they were thus taking. Her attendants gave her to understand as
delicately as they could, that it was far the purpose of castrating
him.</p>

<p>"How unnecessary is so much trouble," said her majesty, "they
have only to give him coffee, and their object will be fully and
easily attained."<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a
href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>Most probably the queen spoke from her own experience of its
anti-aphrodisiacal effects upon her royal consort.</p>

<p>There are some diseases which are considered as
anti-aphrodisiacal, on account of the decided aversion which the
patient who is afflicted with them feels for the pleasures of the
sexual union. Thus a species of epidemic leprosy is common among
the Cossacks of the Jaik, which is attended by pains in the joints
and a disgust for copulation, a disgust the more extraordinary, not
only because exanthematous diseases, in general excite a desire for
the above act, but also inasmuch as this malady, in particular
usually attacks persons in the prime of their youth. Another
disease analogous to the one just mentioned, the Plica-Polonica,
rages, during the autumnal season, in Poland, Lithuania, and
Tartary. It is said to have been introduced into the first of these
countries by the Tartars, who had it originally from India. One of
the most singular phenomena attending this disorder, and which
evidently proves the close sympathy existing between the head and
the organs of generation, is that when the patient is bald, the
Plica not unfrequently fastens upon the sexual parts, and acquires
such a length as to descend below the calves of <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span> the legs.
The made of treatment, that of mercury and sudorifics, proves the
mucous character of the disorder, and, consequently, accounts for
its well known tendency to strike the whole animal economy with
that prostration of strength which produces a total indifference to
the sex.</p>

<p>Continual exercise on horseback was considered by Hippocrates<a
name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200"
class="fnanchor">200</a> as anti-aphrodisiacal and Van Sweiten
commenting upon that opinion, justly observes that the continual
joltings caused by so violent an exercise, added to the compression
produced upon the parts of generation by the weight of the body,
was by no means unlikely to produce a focal relaxation of those
organs to such an extent as to prevent erection altogether.</p>

<p>If whatever opposes an obstacle to the gratification of the
sexual appetite may be considered as having a place among the
anti-aphrodisiacs, certain mechanical processes may be ranked as
such. Of these, <i>fibulation</i>, from the Latin word
<i>fibula</i> (a buckle or ring) was the very reverse of
circumcision, since the operation consisted in drawing the prepuce
over the glans, and preventing its return, by the insertion of the
ring.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>The <i>Fibula</i> (buckle) is so called, because it serves to
fix together and to re-unite parts which are separated. It was,
formerly a surgical instrument which, besides the use now
particularly in question, served also to keep closed the lips of
any extensive wounds. It is mentioned as being so applied by
Oribuse,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and by Scribonius
Largus.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> Employed, therefore, as it
was for various uses, the <i>fibula</i> appears to have different
shapes, now but little known to us. Rhodius<a name="FNanchor_204"
id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class=
"fnanchor">204</a> has treated of all those mentioned in the
writings of antiquity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id=
"Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>Meinsius thinks that the custom of infibulating may be traced
back to the time of the siege of Troy, for the singer Demodocus,
who was left with Clytemnestra by Agamemnon,<a name="FNanchor_205"
id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class=
"fnanchor">205</a> appears to that critic, to have been a eunuch,
or, at least, to here been infibulated.<a name="FNanchor_206" id=
"FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class=
"fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>Among the ancients, as well as among many modern nations, the
laws of chastity and the restraints of honour appeared scarcely
sufficient to hinder the sexes from uniting, in spite of all the
obstacles opposed by a vigilant watch and strict seclusion.<a name=
"FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class=
"fnanchor">207</a> Indeed, what Roman virgin could entertain very
strict ideas of modesty while she saw the goddess of love honoured
in the temple, or the amours of Venus and Mars celebrated, while
the poor cuckolded Vulcan, after seizing the amorous couple in his
net, way only thereby exposed to the ridicule of the Olympic
Divinities. There can be little doubt but that excess of this
description bastardized and corrupted the ancient Greeks and
Romans, and that recourse was necessarily had to the <i>fibula</i>
when the deities themselves set the example. Of what use, indeed,
could be the moral lessons of a Plato or a Socrates, even when
enforced by infibulation, if vice was thus sanctioned by divine
example? The only aim of such a state of things was to vanquish
obstacles. The art of eluding nature was studied, marriage was
despised, notwithstanding the edicts of Augustus against bachelors;
the depopulated republic wallowed in the most abandoned lust, and,
as a natural consequence, the individual members of it became
corrupted and enervated from their very infancy.</p>

<p>The infibulation of boys, sometimes on account of their voice,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140">140</a></span>and not unfrequently, to prevent
masturbation, was performed by having the prepuce drawn over the
glans; it was then pierced, and a thick thread was passed through
it, remaining there until the cicatrizing of the hole; when that
took place, a rather large ring was then substituted, which was not
removed but with the permission of the party ordering the
operation.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> The Romans infibulated
their singers in order to preserve their voice:</p>

<p>Nor were dancers and gladiators exempted from the same
operation, especially the latter, in order that they might preserve
all the vigour required in their horrible and degrading
occupation.</p>

<p>The best description of the <i>fibula</i> is that given by
Holiday: "The fibula," says he, "does not strictly signifie a
button, but also a buckle or clasp, or such like stay. In this
place, the poet expresses by it the instrument of servilitie
applied to those that were employed to sing upon the stage; the
Pr&aelig;tor who set forth playes for the delight of the people,
buying youths for that purpose, and that they might not, by lust,
spoil their voice, their overseers closed their shame with a case
of metal having a sharp spike of the same metal passing by the side
of it, and sometimes used one of another form; or by a nearer
crueltie, they thrust a brazen or silver wire thought that part
which the Jew did lose in circumcision.</p>

<p>"The form of the first, and also another fashion, the curious
reader may here see (being without any immodestie) as they are
represented by Pignerius, <i>de servis</i>, p. 82. But whatsoever
the fashion or invention was, the trust was but fond that was <span

lust and gold could make them as vain as the Italian engines of
jealousy in this day. Thus, 'O Lentulus,' says the poet, speaking
figuratively to some nobleman, 'it is that thou art married; but it
is some musician's or fencer's bastard that is born under thy
lordly canopie.'"<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a

<p>Winkleman furnishes us with a description of an infibulated
musician,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> it being a small bronze
statue representing a naked deformed individual, as thin as a
skeleton, and carrying a ring in his <i>enormi mentula</i>.
Martial, who laughs at everything, speaks of these singers
sometimes breaking their ring, and says that it becomes necessary
to send them to the fibula-makers in order to have the damage
repaired:<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href=

</div>

<p>The practice of infibulation was very common in India, from
religious motives. As a proof of their sanctity, many of the
Santons, or Mohammedan saints, as well as other devout persons,
bonzes, fakirs, and the like, devoted themselves to perpetual
virginity. Whether it was with the intention of placing themselves
beyond the possibility of breaking their vow, or of giving evidence
of their constancy, certain it is that they loaded their prepuce
with an enormous fibula, or ring; and, in their warm climate, where
nudity does not shock ideas of propriety or decency, devout women
not unfrequently repaired to these <i>soi-disant</i> saints, to
admire and venerate such efforts of <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span> virtue and self-denial;
they are even reported to have knelt down, and, in that humiliating
posture, to have kissed the preputial ring, no doubt with the vain
hope of thereby obtaining indulgences. In some places, these
martyrs fasten their fibula with a lock, the key which they deposit
with the magistrate of the town or village. But, nature insisting
upon her rights, is often too strong for this self-violence, nor
can desire, or the not-to-be-mistaken symptom of it, be opposed, or
even prevented, from being gratified; and since the lock, which
obstructs the extremity of the prepuce only, cannot hinder a kind
of erection, nor, indeed, of effusion of the seminal fluid, it
cannot do more than oppose the introduction of the male organ into
the receptacle destined for it.</p>

<p>Another description of fakirs were formerly to be seen in India,
and, especially, in its southern peninsula, whose custom it was to
traverse the country in a state of nudity, and who had been
rendered impotent by the following regimen. The children destined
for this penitential state are taken away from their parents at the
age of six or seven years, and made to eat, daily, a quantity of
the young leaves of a tree called <i>Mairkousie</i>. At first, the
dose given them is not larger than a filbert. This regimen must be
persisted in until the party reaches the age of five-and-twenty
years, the dose being increased till, at the maximum, it is as
large as a duck's egg. During all this time, the devotee is
subjected to no other regimen, except a light purge, once in six
months, by means of <i>Kadoukaie</i>, or the black mirobolan.
Although rendered completely impotent by this mode of treatment, so
far from their physical strength and beauty of form being
diminished or deteriorated thereby, they are, on the contrary,
improved by it; the enjoyment of constant good health is likewise
almost an invariable consequence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id=
"Page_144">144</a></span>Infibulation is not confined to the male
sex exclusively, for it is practised on girls and women in India,
Persia, and the East, generally, and most commonly consists in
joining together the female sexual organ, or closing the labia of
the vagina by a suture made with waxed thread, a small aperture
being left for the egress of the urine and the menstrua.</p>

<p>Linschet witnessed the operation at Pegu, as did also Schultz,
Brown saw it performed, at Darfour, on females from eleven to
twelve years of age.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a
href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> At the time of
marriage, a cut of the bistouri dissevers the parts which have been
closed by the effects of the suture. Sometimes jealousy contents
itself by passing a ring through the parts. Women, as well as
girls, are subjected to this disgusting operation, the only
difference being that the ring of the latter cannot be removed,
while that of the former has a kind of lock, the key of which is in
the husband's possession. Pallas informs us that the beautiful
nation of the Tcherkesses, or Circassians carefully preserve the
virginity of their girls by means of a leathern girdle, or rather
corslet made of skin, and sewn immediately upon the naked body. The
husband alone has the right of severing this corslet, which he
does, on the nuptial night.</p>

<p>When the violation of virgin chastity and conjugal fidelity
became more frequent, fathers and husbands had recourse, even in
Europe, to a mechanical contrivance for the purpose of preserving
intact the honour of the family. This was a kind of padlock, which
shut up all access to the seat of voluptuousness. The invention is
attributed to one Francesco di Carrera, an imperial judge of Padua,
who lived about the close of the 15th century. The machine itself
was called the <i>Girdle of Chastity</i>. Francesco's acts of
cruelty brought him to the scaffold, where <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>he was strangled in
1405, by a decree of the Senate of Venice. One of the principal
accusations brought against him was the employment of the <i>Girdle
of Chastity</i>, for his mistresses, and it is said by Misson<a
name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217"
class="fnanchor">217</a> that a box filled with these articles was
for a long time preserved in the palace of St. Mark, at Venice.
Rabelais speaks of these girdles, which he calls <i>Ceintures</i>
&aacute; la Bergamasque, "Nay," says he, Pantagruel, "may that Nick
in the dark cellar, who hath no white in his eye, carry me quiet
away with him, if, in that case, whenever I go abroad from the
palace of my domestic residence, I do not, with as much
circumspection as they use to ring mares in our country, to keep
them from being saillied by stoned horses, clap a Bergamesco lock
upon my wife." Brantome has the following notice of these chastity
preservers. "Des temps du roi Henri il yeut un certain Quinquallier
qui apporte une douzaine de certains engins &agrave; la foire de
St. Germain pour brider le cas des femmes. Ces sortes de cadenas
estoient en usage &agrave; Venise d&egrave;s devant l'ann&eacute;e
1522, estoient faites de fer et centuroient comme une ceinture, et
venoient &agrave; se prendre par le bas, et se fermer &agrave;
clef, si subtilement faites, qu'il n'estoit pas possible que la
femme en estant brid&eacute;e und fois, s'en peust jamais
pr&eacute;valoir pour ce doux plaisir, n'ayant que quelques petits
trous menus pour servir &agrave; pisser."<a name="FNanchor_218" id=
"FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class=
"fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>An endeavour was made to introduce these Bernasco padlocks into
France during the reign of Henry II., and a shop was opened by an
Italian at the fair of St. Germain, where they were publicly sold,
and in such numbers, that the French gallants, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>becoming
alarmed, threatened to throw the vendor into the Seine, if he did
not pack up his merchandise and decamp, which he immediately did
for fear that the menace might be put in execution.</p>

jealous of his wife Proserpine, was advised:</p>

<p>We shall close this our third essay with the amusing summary of
anti-aphrodisiacal remedies, as given by Rabelais.</p>

<div class="blockquot">"You say," said the physician Rondibilis to
Panurge, "that you feel in you the pricking stings of sensuality,
by which you are stirred up to venery. I find in our faculty of
medicine, and we have founded our opinion therein upon the
deliberate resolution and final decision of the ancient Platonics,
that carnal concupiscence is cooled and quelled five several
ways:&mdash;<br />
<br />
 "<i>Firstly.</i> By the means of wine. I shall easily believe that
quoth Friar John, for when I am well whittled with the juice of the
grape, I care for nothing else, so I may sleep. When I say, quoth
Rondibilis, that wine abateth lust, my meaning is, wine
immoderately taken; for by intemperance, proceeding from the
excessive drinking of strong liquor, there is brought upon the body
of such a swill-down bouser, a chillness in the blood, a slackening
in the sinews, a dissipation of the generative seed, a numbness and
hebetation of the senses, with a perversive wryness and convulsion
of the muscles, all which are <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>great lets and impediments
to the act of generation. Hence it is that Bacchus, the god of
bibbers, tipplers, and drunkards, is most commonly painted
beardless and clad in a woman's habit, as a person altogether
effeminate, or like a libbed eunuch. Wine, nevertheless, taken
moderately worketh quite contrary effects, as is implied by the old
proverb, which saith,&mdash;That Venus taketh cold, when not
accompanied by Ceres and Bacchus.<a name="FNanchor_221" id=
"FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>
This opinion is of great antiquity as appeareth by the testimony of
Diodorus the Sicilian, and confirmed by Pausanias, and it is
usually held among the Lampsacians, that Don Priapus was the son of
Bacchus and Venus.<br />
<br />
 "<i>Secondly.</i> The fervency of lust is abated by certain drugs,
plants herbs and roots, which make the taker cold, maleficiated,
unfit for, and unable to perform the act of generation; as hath
often been experimented by the water-lily, Heraclea, Agnus-Castus,
willow-twigs, hemp-stalks, woodbine, honeysuckle, tamarisk,
chastetree, mandrake, bennet keebugloss, the skin of a
hippopotamus, and many other such, which, by convenient doses
proportioned to the peccant humour and constitution of the patient,
being duly and seasonably received within the body&mdash;what by
their elementary virtues on the one side, and peculiar properties
on the other, do either benumb, mortify and beclumpse with cold,
the prolific semence, or scatter and disperse the spirits which
ought to have gone along with, and conducted the sperm to the
places destined and appointed for its reception,&mdash;or lastly,
shut up, stop and obstruct the way, passages, and conduits, through
which the seed should have expelled, evacuated, and ejected. We
have, nevertheless, of those ingredients, <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>which, being of a
contrary operation, heat the blood, bind the nerves, unite the
spirits, quicken the senses, strengthen the muscles, and thereby
rouse up, provoke, excite and enable a man to the vigorous
accomplishment of the feat of amorous dalliance. I have no need of
those, quoth Panurge, God be thanked and you, my good master.
Howsoever, I pray you, take no exception or offence at these my
words; for what I have said was not out of any ill-will I did hear
to you, the Lord, he knows.<br />
<br />
 <i>Thirdly.</i> The ardour of lechery is very much subdued and
mated by frequent labour and continual toiling. For by painful
exercises and laborous working so great a dissolution is brought
upon the whole body, that the blood which runneth alongst the
channels of the vein thereof for the nourishment and alimentation
of each of its members, had neither time, leisure, nor power to
afford the seminal resudation or superfluity of the third
concoction, which nature most carefully reserves for the
conservation of the individual, whose preservation she more
heedfully regardeth than the propagation of the species and the
multiplication of human kind. Whence it is that Diana is said to be
chaste, because she is never idle, but always busied about hunting.
For the same reason was a camp, or leaguer of old
called&mdash;Castrum,<a name="FNanchor_222" id=
"FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>
as if they would have said&mdash;Castum; because the soldiers,
wrestlers, runners, throwers of the bar, and other such like
athletic champions, as are usually seen in a military
circumvallation, do incessantly travail and turmoil, and are in a
perpetual stir and agitation. To this purpose, also, Hippocrates
writeth in his book, <i>De Aere, Aqua et Locis</i>:&mdash;That in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id=
"Page_150">150</a></span>his time there were people in Scythia as
impotent as eunuchs in the discharge of a venerean exploit; because
that, without any cessation, pause or respite, they were never from
off horseback, or otherwise, assiduously employed in some
troublesome and molesting drudgery.<br />
<br />
 On the other part, in opposition and repugnancy hereto, the
philosophers say, that idleness is the mother of luxury. When it
was asked Ovid, why &AElig;gisthus became an adulterer? he made no
other answer than this, Because he was idle.<a name="FNanchor_223"
id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class=
"fnanchor">223</a> Who were able to rid the world of loitering and
idleness might easily disappoint Cupid<a name="FNanchor_224" id=
"FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
of all his designes, aims, engines and devices and so disable and
appal him, that his bow, quiver, and darts should from thenceforth
be a mere needless load and burthen to him; for that it could not
then lie in his power to strike or wound any of either sex with all
the arms he had. He is not, I believe so expert an archer as that
he can hit the cranes flying in the air, or yet the young stags
skipping through the thicket, as the Parthians knew well how to do;
that is to say, people moiling, stirring, and hurrying up and down,
restless and without repose. He must have those hushed, still,
quiet, lying at a stay, lither and full of ease, whom he is able to
pierce with all his arrows. In conformation thereof, Theophrastus
being asked on a time, What kind of beast or thing he judged a
toyish, wanton love to be? he made answer, That it was a passion of
idle and sluggish spirits.<a href="#Footnote_224" class=
"fnanchor">224</a> From which pretty description of
tickling-tricks, that of Diogenes, the Cynic, was not very
discrepant when he defined lechery&mdash;The occupation of folk
destitute of all <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id=
"Page_151">151</a></span>other occupation. For this cause the
Sicyonian sculptor Canachus,<a name="FNanchor_225" id=
"FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>
being desirous to give us to understand that slowth, drowsiness,
negligence, and laziness, were the prime guardians and governesses
of ribaldry, made the statue of Venus, not standing, as other
stone-cutters had used to do, but sitting.<br />
<br />
 <i>Fourthly.</i> The tickling pricks of incontinency are blunted
by an eager study; for from thence proceedeth an incredible
resolution of the spirits, that oftentimes there do not remain so
many behind as may suffice to push and thrust forwards the
generative resudation to the places thereto appropriated, and
therewithal inflate the cavernous nerve, whose office is to
ejaculate the moisture for the propagation of human progeny. Lest
you should think it is not so, be pleased but to contemplate a
little the form, fashion, and carriage of a man exceeding earnestly
set upon some learned meditation and deeply plunged therein, and
you shall see how all the arteries of his brains are stretched
forth, and bent like the string of a cross-bow, the more promptly,
dexterously and copiously to suppeditate, furnish and supply him
with store of spirits, sufficient to replenish and fill up the
ventricles, seats, tunnels, mansions, receptacles and cellules of
common sense&mdash;of the imagination apprehension, and
fancy&mdash;of the ratiocination, arguing, and resolution&mdash;as
likewise, of the memory, recordation, and remembrance; and with
great alacrity, nimbleness, and agility, to run, pass and course
from one to the other, through those pipes, windings, and conduits,
which to skilful anatomists are perceivable at the end of the
wonderful net, where all the arteries close in a terminating point;
which arteries taking their rise and origin from the left capsule
of the heart, bring, through several <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>circuits, ambages, and
anfractuosities, the vital spirits, to subtilize and refine them in
the &aelig;therial purity of animal spirits. Nay, in such a
studiously meditating, musing person, you may espy so extravagant
raptures of one, as it were out of himself, that all his natural
faculties for that time will seem to lie suspended from each their
proper charge and office, and his exterior senses to be at a stand.
In a word, you cannot choose than think, that he is by an
extraordinary ecstasy quite transported out of what he was or
should be; and that Socrates did not speak improperly when he said,
That philosophy was nothing else but a meditation upon death. This
possibly is the reason why Democritus<a name="FNanchor_226" id=
"FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>
deprived himself of the sense of seeing, prizing, at a much lower
rate, the loss of his sight, than the diminution of his
contemplation which he had frequently found disturbed by the
vagrant flying-out strayings of his unsettled and roving eyes.<a
name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227"
class="fnanchor">227</a> Therefore is it that Pallas, the goddess
of wisdom, tutoress and guardianess of such as are diligently
studious and painfully industrious, is and hath been still
accounted a virgin. The Muses upon the same consideration are
esteemed perpetual maids: and the Graces, for the same reason, have
been held to continue in a sempiternal pudicity.<br />
<br />
 I remember to have read that Cupid,<a href="#Footnote_227" class=
"fnanchor">227</a> on a time, being asked by his mother Venus, why
he did not assault and set upon the Muses, his answer was, that he
found them so fair, so <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id=
"Page_153">153</a></span>neat, so wise, so learned, so modest, so
discreet, so courteous, so virtuous, and so continually busied and
employed,&mdash;one in the speculation of the stars,&mdash;another
in the supputation of numbers,&mdash;the third in the dimension of
geometrical quantities,&mdash;the fourth in the composition of
heroic poems,&mdash;the fifth in the jovial interludes of a comic
strain,&mdash;the sixth in the stately gravity of the tragic
vein,&mdash;the seventh in the melodious disposition of musical
airs,&mdash;the eighth in the completest manner of writing
histories and books on all sorts of subjects, and&mdash;the ninth
in the mysteries, secrets, and curiosities of all sciences,
faculties, disciplines and arts whatsoever, whether liberal or
mechanic,&mdash;that approaching near unto them he unbent his bow,
shut his quiver, and extinguished his torch, through mere shame and
fear that by mischance he might do them any hurt or prejudice.
Which done, he thereafter put off the fillet wherewith his eyes
were bound, to look them in the face, and to hear their melody and
poetic odes. There took he the greatest pleasure in the world, that
many times he was transported with their beauty and pretty
behaviour, and charmed asleep by their harmony, so far was he from
assaulting them or interrupting their studies. Under this article
may be comprised what Hippocrates wrote in the afore-cited treatise
concerning the Scythians, as also that in a book of his intituled,
Of Breeding and Production, where he hath affirmed all such men to
be unfit for generation as have their parotid arteries
cut&mdash;whose situation is behind the ears&mdash;for the reason
given already, when I was speaking of the resolution of the
spirits, and of that spiritual blood, whereof the arteries are the

 <i>Fifthly.</i> By the too frequent reiteration of the act of
venery. There did I wait for you, quoth Panurge, and shall
willingly apply it to myself, whilst any one that pleaseth may, for
me, make use of any of the four preceding. That is the very same
thing, quoth Friar John, which Father Scyllion,<a name=
"FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class=
"fnanchor">228</a> Prior of St. Victor, at Marseilles, calleth
maceration and taming of the flesh. I am of the same opinion, and
so was the hermit of Saint Radegonde, a little above Chinon; for,
quoth he, the hermits of Theba&iuml;de can no way more aptly or
expediently macerate and bring down the pride of their bodies,
daunt and mortify their lecherous sensuality, or depress and
overcome the stubbornness and rebellion of the flesh, than by
dufling and fanfreluching five and twenty or thirty times a
day."</div>

of the first of them, observes: "Cette figure repr&eacute;sente le

Only persons who have great interest can get a sight of it. Is it
from this stone having some peculiar virtue that those <i>preux

curious to hear an opinion of Madame Du Barri's beauty from the
lips of one who has seen her both in her days of prosperity and
after her downfall. She was a person of small, almost diminutive
stature, extremely frail and delicate in feature, which saved her
from being vulgar; but even from the first, she always wore that
peculiarly <i>fane</i> look which she owed to a youth of
dissipation, a maturity of unbounded indulgence. At the period of
my visit she was about thirty-six years of age, but, from her
child-like form and delicacy of countenance, appeared much younger,
and her <i>gambades</i> and unrestrained gestures of supreme
delight on having, as she said, <i>quelqu'un &agrave; qui
parler</i>, did not seem displaced. Although alone, and evidently
not in expectation of visitors, her toilet was brilliant and
<i>recherch&eacute;</i>, the result of the necessity of killing
time."&mdash;"Talleyrand Papers."</p>

must, however, be observed, that this story is wholly incredible,
inasmuch as the same writers affirm that Democritus employed his
leisure in writing books and in dissecting the bodies of animals,
neither of which could very well be effected without the eyes.</p>

is the same as that related by Poggio (Bracciolini) of a hermit of
Pisa. "Eremita," says he, "qui Pisis morabatur, tempore Petri
Gambacurt&aelig;, meretricem noctu in suam ce lulan deduxit,
vigesiesque ea nocte mulierem cognovit; semper cum moveret clunes,
ut crimen fugeret luxuri&aelig; vulgaribus verbis dicens: 'domati,
carne cattizella;' hoc est, doma te, miserrima caro!"</p>
